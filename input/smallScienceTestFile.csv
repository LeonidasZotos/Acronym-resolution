FL,federated learning,DEV-0,"In , we investigated the FL loss function minimization problem with taking into account packet errors over wireless links ."
RF,random forest,DEV-1,The nature of the regression algorithm makes that the output of the RF is the continuous value which better satisfies the constraints learn during training .
CNN,convolutional neural network,DEV-2,"Particularly , we explore four CNN architectures , AlexNet , GoogLeNet , VGG-16 , and ResNet to derive features for all images in our dataset , which are labeled as private or public ."
DE,differential evolution,DEV-3,h ] DE computational flowchart .
RF,radio frequency,DEV-4,"Li - Fi , being a safe and high speed alternative to RF emergency communication set - ups , this concept , if implemented can save the lives of many ."
LSU,louisiana state university,DEV-5,fig : comparison_efficiency_SuperMIC for LSU SuperMic data .
CT,computed tomography,DEV-6,Each column represents one CT image .
CNN,convolutional neural network,DEV-7,"Because its loss function assigns the same importance to every misclassified example , the baseline CNN model overfits dawn audio clips and underfits dusk audio clips ."
RNN,recurrent neural network,DEV-8,"Generally , the results of the temporal RNN are much better than those of the spatial RNN ."
RF,regression function,DEV-9,[ 1mm]Suppose is the parameter that determines a specific splitting node of RF regression trees .
ACI,adjacent channel interference,DEV-10,"Note that the total signal power and interference power received by VUE in RB can be computed as follows , align S_j , f , t & = _ i T_j X_i , f , t P_i , t H_i , j definitionS , I_j , f , t & = _ k T_j X_k , f , t P_k , t H_k , j & + Ff ' = 1 f ' f _ k 1^N X_k , f',t P_k , t H_k , j , definitionI alignNote that , the first term in definitionI is CCI from non - neighbouring VUEs , and the second term is ACI from all transmitting VUEs ."
