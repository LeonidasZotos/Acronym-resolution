POI,postoperative ileus,TS-60,retroperitoneoscopy has gained popularity because it offers a safe alternative to the more debilitating open approach and avoids POI however this type of procedure carries certain disadvantages in terms of intraperitoneal effusions and hemodynamic changes major complications are exceptional we describe the case of a yearold man who died of carbon dioxide embolism during elective TEP tep inguinal hernioplasty for symptomatic left indirect IH with the patient under GA anesthesia the retroperitoneal space was gained through a cm incision made below the umbilicus during the dissection the patient collapsed and could not be resuscitated at autopsy air bubbles were admixed with blood in the Epi veins but no injury to vessels was demonstrated we conclude that carbon dioxide embolism usually is caused by direct puncture of major vessels during IA procedures however when this complication occurs during retroperitoneoscopy it seems related to pressureforced entry of carbon dioxide into the venous plexus

CHL,conductive hearing loss,TS-187,sensory deprivation during OD induces lifelong changes to CE NS CF that are associated with perceptual impairments however the relationship between neural and behavioral deficits is uncertain due to a lack of simultaneous measurements during task performance therefore we telemetrically recorded from AEP SC SN in gerbils reared with developmental CHL as they performed an auditory task in which rapid fluctuations in amplitude are detected these data were compared to a measure of AEP brainstem temporal processing from each animal we found that developmental hl diminished behavioral performance but did not alter BS temporal processing however the simultaneous assessment of neural and behavioral processing revealed that perceptual deficits were associated with a degraded cortical population code that could be explained by greater trialtotrial response R2 our findings suggest that the perceptual limitations that attend early hearing loss are best explained by an encoding deficit in auditory cortex

SS,supersaturation,TS-405,drugs with low aqueous solubility commonly show low and erratic absorption after oral administration myriad approaches have therefore been developed to promote drug solubilization in the gastrointestinal gi fluids here we offer insight into the unique manner by which lipidbased formulations lbfs may enhance the absorption of poorly watersoluble drugs via costimulation of CMS and supersaturation SS provides an opportunity to generate drug concentrations in the gi tract that are in excess of the equilibrium crystalline solubility and therefore higher than that achievable with traditional formulations incorporation of lbf into lipid digestion and absorption pathways provides multiple drivers of SS generation and the potential to enhance thermodynamic activity and absorption these drivers include formulation dispersion lipid digestion interaction with bile and lipid absorption however high supersaturation ratios may also stimulate drug precipitation and reduce exposure where redissolution limits absorption the most effective formulations are likely to be those that generate moderate SS and do so close to the site of absorption lbfs are particularly well suited to these criteria since CMS protects against high supersaturation ratios and SS initiation typically occurs in the small intestine at the absorptive membrane

MP,myenteric plexus,TS-559,gastrointestinal stromal tumor gist is the most frequent spindle MCT in the gastrointestinal tract and may arise from esophagus to rectum the stomach is the most frequent site followed by small intestine rectum and esophagus there have been some regional differences reported in their histopathologic and clinical presentations the purpose of this T0 is to compare ultrastructural features of gist according to its anatomic site in order to provide additional data to support the current concept of its histogenesis fiftyfour gists from stomach from small intestine and from rectum were included in the study histopathologically gastric gists tended to be more frequently epithelioid particularly those in children while SI gists sists were mostly spindly in all but three cases all four of the rectal gists were spindly ultrastructurally there seem to be considerable regional differences in the majority of gastric gists in both epithelioid and spindle types RT cells exhibited focal features of myoid differentiation evidenced by the presence of incomplete external lamina el andor focal accumulations of thin SF with interrupted electron densities consistent with AFs however features of myoid differentiation were exceptional for sists and rectal gists being present in only one example in each some gastric gists particularly those having an epithelioid appearance showed cell borders luxuriously decorated by long filopods anemone cell features anemone cell features were also present in spindle cell types of gastric gists as well as sists albeit it was simpler and less luxuriant skeinoid SF were present in the majority of sists and rectal gists but absent in all gastric gists except one these differences appeared to be too significant to propose a uniform histogenesis for all gists nevertheless on closer analysis certain features could be identified to explain a L1 of differentiation in all gists ranging from polygonal uncommitted epithelioid mesenchymal cells with cell borders decorated by luxuriant fimbria to spindly tumor cells with less prominent fimbria or cells with or without features of minimum myoid differentiation characterized by the focal presence of cytoplasmic actin fibers or incomplete el or skeinoid fibers which might represent an altered product of el protein these findings led the author to speculate that the probable primordial cells of gist may be the primitive mesenchymal cells which have the potential to differentiate into myoid cells in this regard it is important to note that the putative primordial cell of gist interstitial cells of cajal icc and intestinal smooth muscle cells have been shown to develop from the common progenitor cells of the primitive gut and ckit plays a crucial role in the determination of their fate to differentiate to muscle cells or icc the author concludes that all gists derive from stem cells in the gut retaining some of the differentiation potential seen in primitive gut cells one of the likely candidates for such cells in the intestinal musculature is iccdmp interstitial cells of cajal associated with deep muscular plexus identified as icc having smooth muscle features identified exclusively by electron microscopy these cells have been shown to have some of the features of muscle cells by the presence of external lamina and less wellorganized cytoplasmic filaments they also express cd in the cytoplasm furthermore recent studies demonstrated the presence of socalled progenitor cells of icc similar to iccdmp in appearance expressing insulinlike growth factor and cd indicating their SC nature the author proposes that all gists develop from the common progenitor cells similar to primitive gut cells which may differentiate into tumor cells with more myoid features in the stomach similar to socalled iccdmp as well as spindle cells with less myoid features similar to iccmp interstitial cells of cajal associated with the MP in the small intestine and rectum iccdmp have been recruited in the group of icc by electron microscopic technique alone without methylene blue stain and it is questionable whether they are part of icc depicted by the icc network originally shown by dr cajal more than century ago recent discovery of their expression of insulinlike growth AF may indicate that they represent persisting primitive gut cells gut stem cells which may serve as the progenitor cells to gist it is also pointed out that in this era of icc and gist pandemonium a minority of intestinal stromal PT with mature smooth muscle features have been totally ignored these now appear to belong to gists representing the best differentiated example among the PT developing from the same progenitor cells

Fe3+,ferric iron,TS-804,acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is one of the most widely used microorganisms in bioleaching operations to recover copper from lowgrade copper sulfide ores this work aimed to investigate the relative expression of genes related to the iron uptake system when a ferrooxidans lr was maintained in contact with chalcopyrite or bornite as the sole SE source RT QPCR analysis revealed that the presence of bornite had no effect on the expression of seven genes related to the siderophoremediated feiii uptake system while in the presence of chalcopyrite the expression of the genes was upregulated bioinformatic analysis of the genomic region where these genes were found revealed the existence of three new putative dnabinding sequences for the Fe3+ uptake transcriptional regulator fur electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that a purified a ferrooxidans histagged fur protein was able to bind in vitro to each of these putative fur boxes suggesting that fur regulated the expression of these genes the expression of fur and two known furregulated genes mnth and dsrk was also investigated in the presence of chalcopyrite while the expression of fur and mnth was upregulated the expression of dsrk was downregulated the low amount of ferrous iron in the medium was probably responsible for the upregulation of fur and the genes related to the siderophoremediated feiii uptake system when a ferrooxidans lr was kept in the presence of chalcopyrite a homology model of the a ferrooxidans fur was constructed and revealed that the putative dnabinding surface presents conserved positively charged residues supporting a previously suggested mode of interaction with dna the upregulation of fur and the siderophoremediated feiii uptake genes and the downregulation of dsrk suggest that in the presence of chalcopyrite fur acts as a transcription inducer and repressor

APS,aerodynamic particle sizer,TS-922,an understanding of the scaling laws governing aerosol sampler performance leads to new options for testing aerosol samplers at small scale in a small laboratory wind tunnel two methods are described in this paper the first involves an extension of what is referred to as the conventional approach in which scaled aerosol sampler systems are tested in a small wind tunnel while exposed to relatively monodisperse aerosols such aerosols are collected by test and REF samplers respectively and assessed gravimetrically the new studies were carried out for a modified low flowrate version of the iom personal inhalable aerosol sampler it was shown that such experiments can be carried out with a very high level of repeatability and this supported the GA validity of the aerosol sampler scaling laws the second method involves a novel testing system and protocol for evaluating the performances of aerosol samplers here scaled aerosol samplers of interest are exposed to polydisperse aerosols again in a small wind tunnel in this instance the sampled particles are counted and sized using a directreading APS the aps a prototype automated aerosol sampler testing system based on this RPA was built and evaluated in preliminary experiments to determine the performance of another modified version of the iom personal inhalable aerosol sampler the design of the new test system accounts for the complex fluid mechanical coupling that occurs near the sampler inlet involving the transition between the external flow outside the sampler and the internal airflow inside the sampler leading in turn to uncontrolled particle losses the problem was overcome by the insertion of porous plastic foam plugs where the penetration characteristics are well understood into the entries of both the test and the REF samplers preliminary experiments with this new system also supported the GA validity of the aerosol sampler scaling laws in addition they demonstrated high potential that this RPA may be applied in a standardised aerosol testing method and protocol

NCR,noncoding regions,TS-998,many NCR of genomes appear to be essential to genome function conservation of C1 numbers of noncoding sequences has been reported repeatedly among mammals but not thus far among birds and reptiles by searching genomes of chicken gallus gallus zebra finch taeniopygia guttata and green anole anolis carolinensis we quantified the conservation among birds and reptiles and across amniotes of long conserved noncoding sequences lcns which we define as sequences â\x89¥ bp in length and exhibiting â\x89¥ similarity between species we found lcns shared between chicken and zebra finch and lcns shared by the two birds and anolis the percent of genomes comprised by lcns in the two birds is notably higher than the percent in mammals to differences that we show may be explained in part by differences in genomewide substitution rates we reconstruct a C1 number of lcns for the amniote ancestor ca and hypothesize differential loss and substantial turnover of these CS in descendent lineages by contrast we estimated a small role for recruitment of lcns via acquisition of novel functions over time across amniotes lcns are significantly enriched with transcription factor IB CS for many developmental genes and of lcns shared between the two birds show evidence of expression in brain EST databases these results show that the rate of PR of lcns from the amniote ancestor differs between mammals and reptilia including birds and that this may reflect differing roles and constraints in gene regulation
LM,longitudinal muscle,TS-999,an internal receiver coil was used to obtain high resolution transverse and oblique coronal magnetic resonance images of the anal sphincter in five NV and five patients the internal sphincter had a high signal intensity on t weighted t weighted and stir sequences whereas the conjoined LM and external sphincter had a low signal intensity the internal sphincter but not the external sphincter showed CE T3 administration of intravenous gadopentetate dimeglumine the oblique coronal plane was particularly useful for showing the thickness and the relations of the external sphincter sphincteric abscesses as well as muscle defects hypertrophy and atrophy were clearly shown the coil was well tolerated by most subjects it has considerable potential for improving the diagnosis of anorectal disease
PNs,purkinje neurons,TS-1000,the active and passive membrane properties of developing PNs in control cultures and cultures chronically treated with or mm ethanol for or weeks were examined using wholecell currentclamp techniques the membrane properties were characterized by the features of the voltage responses evoked by intracellular current i.t. of a series of ON and hyperpolarizing current pulses analysis of these responses and background spontaneous activity showed several differences between the control and ethanoltreated purkinje SN membrane input resistance was significantly larger in the ethanoltreated neurons the percentage of neurons exhibiting immature firing patterns was significantly higher in the ethanoltreated SN the afterhyperpolarization following a currentevoked train of action potentials was significantly larger in the ethanoltreated neurons SA synaptic potentials and synaptically evoked spike events was significantly reduced in neurons treated with mm ethanol for week spontaneous activity in neurons treated with mm ethanol for or weeks was similar to that observed in the control group these differences indicate that ethanol exposure during development directly alters the physiological properties of this cns neuronal type these neuronal actions of ethanol may contribute to the behavioral deficits observed in animals models of fetal alcohol syndrome similar target sites of ethanol action are likely to be present in the human cns neurons and may be involved in human FAS

PP,pancreatic polypeptide,TS-1083,mediation of PP pancreatic enzyme secretion has been ascribed mainly to cholecystokinin and to vagovagal reflexes recent studies suggest that these pathways are subject to feedback regulation diversion of pancreatic juice from the duodenum stimulates cholecystokinin PR and pancreatic enzyme secretion and i.d. of trypsin or chymotrypsin inhibits cholecystokinin release and pancreatic secretion the increased plasma cholecystokinin C2 following diversion of PJ seems to be mediated by cholecystokininreleasing factor a trypsinsensitive substance secreted by the PT small intestine this factor may mediate pancreatic enzyme secretion in response to protein NI dietary protein in the intestine competes for the TR that would otherwise inactivate the factor the resulting increase of this factor in the intestinal lumen releases cholecystokinin and stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion enteropancreatic reflex can also be activated by distension or administration of hyperosmolar solutions in the duodenum eliciting pancreatic enzyme secretion without raising plasma cholecystokinin levels this effect is inhibited by atropine suggesting that it is cholinergically mediated pancreatic response to DU volume or osmolality is not suppressed by trypsin indicating that the reflex is not affected by intraluminal proteases our studies also show that secretion of PP is under ACh control and this peptide acts by interfering with ACh transmission making it an ideal candidate to modulate pancreatic secretion stimulated by the vagal ACh pathway similar observations are made with somatostatin and calcitoningene related peptide which also acts preferentially to inhibit pancreatic secretion by the vagal ACh pathway

PFP,perforin,TS-1703,cytotoxic lymphocytes are key elements of the IS that are primarily responsible for targeting cells infected with intracellular pathogens or cells that have become malignantly transformed target cells are killed mainly via lymphocyte exocytosis of specialized lysosomes containing PFP a poreforming protein and granzymes which are proteases that induce apoptosis due to its CE role in lymphocyte biology as well as its implication in a host of pathologies from CA to autoimmunity the granzymeperforin pathway has been the subject of extensive investigation nevertheless the details of exactly how granzyme and perforin cooperate to induce targetcell death remain controversial to further investigate this system we developed a biophysical model of the immunological synapse between a cytotoxic lymphocyte and a target cell using a spatial stochastic simulation algorithm we used this MM to calculate the spatiotemporal evolution of granzyme b and PFP from the time of their exocytosis to granzyme internalization by the target cell we used a metric of granzyme internalization to delineate which biological processes were critical for successful targetcell lysis we found that the high AR of the immunological synapse was insufficient in this regard and that molecular crowding within the synapse is critical to preserve sufficient concentrations of PFP and granzyme for consistent pore formation and granzyme transfer to target cells however even when pore formation occurs in our model a large amount of both granzyme and PFP still escape from the synapse we argue that a tight seal between the cytotoxic lymphocyte and its target cell is not required to avoid bystander killing instead we propose that the requirement for spatiotemporal colocalization of granzyme and perforin acts as an ERP bimolecular filter to ensure target specificity

CA,coldacclimated,TS-2034,because the massspecific SP generated by myotomal muscle during swimming varies along the length of the fish a realistic assessment of TP generation by the musculature requires integrating the product of massspecific SP and muscle mass at each position over the length of the fish as a first step toward this goal we examined the CSD of red pink and WG muscle along the length of stenotomus chrysops scup using histochemical and image analysis techniques the largest crosssectional area of red fibers occurs at of total fish length and declines both anteriorly and posteriorly by contrast WG fibers have the largest crosssectional area in the anterior and decline dramatically moving posteriorly the proportion of the fishes crosssection occupied by red fibers increases from to moving posteriorly along the length of the fish in contrast the proportion of crosssectional area occupied by pink fibers is constant while the proportional crosssectional area of white SF falls from to the red pink and WG fibers comprise and respectively of total fish weight we also compared the CSD of muscle in degrees c and degrees c acclimated animals the value for red fiber volume though slightly higher in CA fish is not statistically different no difference was found in pink or WG SF finally the finding that most of the red muscle is in the posterior half of the fish further supports the notion that most SP for steady swimming at moderate speeds comes from posterior rather than anterior musculature

PX,pinealectomy,TS-2208,melatonin is neuroprotective because of its antioxidative action but it also can modify neuronal vulnerability by altering mRNA lipoxygenase lo gene expression is suppressed by the binding of melatonin to its highaffinity nuclear receptors recently we reported that in rats the melatonin deficiency elicited by PX increases HPC susceptibility to excitotoxic injury here we have hypothesized that PX may increase hippocampal vulnerability by eliminating the tonic inhibitory action of melatonin on lo mRNA shampinealectomized controls and pinealectomized rats were killed days T3 surgery their hippocampi were dissected and total rna was extracted and processed for quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase RT-PCR of lo and cyclophilin mrnas mutated primers were used as internal standards to assay attomole quantities of these two specific mrnas per microgram of total rna the ratio locycophilin was used to compare samples from control and pinealectomized rats PX increased hippocampal lo mrna content by about threefold these results support our hypothesis that melatonin deficiency may abate the tonic inhibition of lo mrna expression and thereby upregulate lo mRNA which in turn would increase the brains synthesis rate of potentially harmful eicosanoids leukotrienes
ALS,alternating least squares,TS-2209,canonical polyadic decomposition candecomp cpd also known as parallel FA parafac is widely applied to nthorder n â\x89¥ tensor analysis existing cpd methods mainly use ALS iterations and hence need to unfold tensors to each of their n modes frequently which is one L1 performance bottleneck for largescale data especially when the order n is C1 to overcome this problem in this paper we propose a new cpd method in which the cpd of a highorder tensor ie n is realized by applying cpd to a mode reduced one typically thirdorder tensor followed by a khatrirao product projection procedure this way is not only quite efficient as frequently unfolding to n modes is avoided but also promising to conquer the bottleneck problem caused by high collinearity of components we show that under mild conditions any nthorder cpd can be converted to an equivalent thirdorder one but without destroying essential uniqueness and theoretically they simply give consistent results besides once the cpd of any unfolded lower order tensor is essentially unique it is also true for the cpd of the original higher order tensor error bounds of truncated cpd are also analyzed in the presence of noise simulations show that compared with stateoftheart cpd methods the proposed method is more efficient and is able to escape from local solutions more easily

GEM,genetically engineered mice,TS-2310,clonidine and related alpha adrenergic CD25 ar agonists lower arterial pressure primarily by an action within the central nervous system these drugs also have varying degrees of affinity for other cellular components called nonadrenergic IBS naibs for over years the alpha ar agonist activity of clonidinelike drugs was thought to account for their therapeutic effects alpha theory however several CG have recently proposed a competing imidazoline theory according to which the hypotensive effect of clonidinelike drugs would in fact owe more to their affinity for one type of naibs called i receptors the alpha theory is strongly supported by four main types of congruent data first the hypotensive effect of systemically po clonidine is blocked by alpha ar antagonists that are without affinity for i naibs second the hypotensive effect of intravenous clonidine is absent in GEM in which a defective alpha aar has been substituted for the normal one third the sympatholytic effect of clonidine is consistent with the presence of conventional inhibitory alpha ars on sympathetic preganglionic neurons and on their main excitatory inputs in the MO fourth the first i ligand without affinity for alpha ars was found to be biologically inactive the imidazoline theory is supported by a limited repertoire of whole animal in vivo pharmacological experiments that remain open to a wide range of interpretations in conclusion the bulk of the evidence strongly supports a largely predominant role of alpha ar mechanisms in the action of most clonidinelike agents at therapeutically relevant doses or concentrations even the small pharmacological differences between these agents cannot yet be linked with certainty to their relative affinity for i naibs

MT,morphological transformation,TS-3312,the parietal cell of the GM undergoes rapid MT when it is stimulated to produce HCl in chemically fixed cells this process is seen as a reduction in number of cytoplasmic tubulovesicles as the apical surface of the cell progressively invaginates to increase the sec surface area it is widely believed that the tubulovesicles represent stored sec membrane in the cytoplasm of the unstimulated cell which is incorporated into the apical membrane upon stimulation because they share hkatpase activity with the apical membrane however F0 of tubulovesicles with the apical membrane concomitant with PCA activation has never been convincingly demonstrated we have used fast freezefixation and freezesubstitution to study stages of morphological transformation in these cells tubulovesicles were not seen in the cytoplasm of any of our cryoprepared cells instead the cytoplasm of the unstimulated cell contained numerous and densely packed helical coils of tubule each having an axial core of cytoplasm the helical coils were linked together by connecting tubules lengths of relatively straight tubule lengths of straight connecting tubule also extended from coils lying adjacent to the apical and cLPM surfaces and ended at the apical and canaliculus membranes immunogold labelling with alpha and betasubunitspecific antibodies showed that the gastric hkatpase was localized to the CM of this tubular system which therefore represented the configuration of the secretory membrane in the cytoplasm of the unstimulated PCA stimulation of the cells with histamine and isobutylmethylxanthine lead to modification of the tubular membrane system correlated with progressive invagination of the apical membrane the volume of the tubule lumen increased and as this occurred the tight spiral twist of the helical coils was lost indicating that tubule distension was accounted for by partial unwinding this exposed the cores of cytoplasm in the axes of the coils as rodshaped elements of a threedimensional reticulum resembling a series of MV in random thin sections conversely treatment with the h antagonist cimetidine caused severe contraction of the tubular membrane system and intracellular canaliculi our results indicate that tubulovesicles are an artifact of chemical fixation consequently they cannot have a role in parietal cell transformation from our findings we propose an alternative model for MT in the PCA this MM predicts cytoskeletonmediated control over expansion and contraction of the tubular membrane network revealed by cryopreparation the MM is compatible with the localization of cytoskeletal components in these cells
