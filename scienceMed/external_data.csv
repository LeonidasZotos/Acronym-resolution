MMA,monomethylamine,EXT,consumption of fish has been encouraged recently because it may prevent mortality due to heart disease fish contains methylamines which are precursors of nnitrosamines nitrosamines can act as potent carcinogens in a wide variety of animal species and there is no reason to assume that humans are resistant human subjects n ingested a diet of known methylamine content for days on day they ate fish at the luncheon and dinner meals on day they again ate the control diet a single portion of fish contained as many methylamines as were normally excreted by the human in days urinary excretion of MMA remained constant to mumol hkg of body weight throughout the study dimethylamine excretion increased more than fold after fish was eaten from to mumol hkg of body weight while TMA excretion increased more than fold from to mumol hkg of body weight we conclude that the consumption of fish significantly increased exposure to methylamines particularly to dimethylamine although there is potential for the in vivo conversion of dimethylamine to nitrosodimethylamine a carcinogen we know of no studies that have determined that the ingestion of fish increases the risk of cancer this should be carefully investigated prior to recommending that humans NC their eating habits

MTD,methadone,EXT,a recent survey has shown that nepali DUs in hong kong tend to have a low rate of usage of daycare and residential rehabilitation services but a high rate of usage of MTD services little is known about the reasons behind such a DP therefore in this study a month ethnographic examination has been implemented in three CS including a daycare center residential rehabilitation center and MTD clinic to explore the experiences of nepali drug users in their use of drugrelated services in hong kong and to examine the relationship between ethnicity and the use of drugrelated services the result shows that the reason for this pattern of service use is related to the approach of the services and the cultural perception of the service providers about the service users the daycare and residential rehabilitation services emphasize an integrated approach but the staff tend to overlook the heterogeneity of their clients for example the differences in caste and sex and fail to provide suitable services to them whereas the methadone service follows a biomedical model which seldom addresses the social characteristics of the service users which in turn minimizes the opportunity for misunderstandings between the staff and the clients this research shows that ethnicity is a significant factor in drug treatment and that culturespecific treatment that takes into consideration the treatment approach and the heterogeneity of the clients is strongly needed

AC,acid ceramidase,EXT,two isoenzymes of ceramidase including lysosomal AC and nonlysosomal alkaline ceramidase catalyze the Kd of ceramide in cultured human skin fibroblasts a genetically determined disorder of sphingolipid metabolism farbersdisease is characterized by the deficiency of acid ceramidase and by the pathological accumulation of ceramide in this report we take advantage of this genetic deficiency to study the intracellular transport of reconstituted LD lipoprotein ldl containing ceramide and of ceramidecontaining liposomes into lysosomes our findings show that there is decreased incorporation of ldl in farbers diseased fibroblasts presumably related to the lack of lysosomal degradation of ceramide in turnover experiments the deficiency of lysosomal AC in farbers disease fibroblasts leads to the complete lack of degradation of ceramide internalized through the ldl uptake process in contrast this genetic defect does not affect either the uptake or turnover of ceramidecontaining phosphatidylcholine liposomes comparison of these results suggests that in cultured skin fibroblasts the coated vesicles containing ceramideldl are designated for lysosomal delivery and are clearly distinguished from endocytotic vesicles involved in the uptake of ceramidecontaining liposomes which may be destined to be transported into subcellular organelles other than lysosomes

CBF,cerebral,EXT,it is clear from reviewing the findings of our own studies and those of others that the CBF cortex has combined two very different strategies of organisation firstly it has a strictly defined genetically determined ATP of specific neurons classes specific rules for which kinds of cells interconnect a laminar architecture where efferent and afferent relays and interlaminar links are predetermined but as well a second strategy allows great developmental lability in the precise spatial patterns of intralaminar circuits of the excitatory neurons and in the actual weights of excitatory and GABA synapses that are contributed to each neuron this second strategy presumably allows the SC to be tailormade to the early experience of each individual and as well allow for lability of responses to different conditions of stimulation and adjustment of the system to compensate to some degree for injuries affecting afferents and circuitry in the adult system

DMG,dimethylglycine,EXT,plasma homocysteine hcy levels are increased significantly in patients with moderate renal failure and increase markedly in patients with endstage renal disease an increase in plasma hcy level theoretically could be caused by an increased production rate ie transmethylation a decreased rate of removal by transsulfuration or remethylation or a decrease in the excretion of hcy current evidence indicates that the L1 mechanism for hyperhomocysteinemia in renal failure is a decrease in hcy removal from the body however it is debated whether this effect is the result of a decrease in the renal metabolic clearance or a result of extrarenal metabolic changes the human kidney plays a major role in the removal of several aminothiols or hcyrelated compounds from the circulation eg cysteineglycine glutathione adomet and adohcy however the glomerular filtration of hcy seems to be restricted because of protein binding besides glomerular filtration the normal kidney can remove hcy by plasma flow and peritubular uptake although in the low normal range in absolute terms the flow through the transsulfuration pathway is reduced if related to hcy C2 in uremia in addition the remethylation pathway also is impaired besides the potential effect of the reduced renal mass on hcy removal available evidence suggests the occurrence of a generalized downregulation of the Met cycle and catabolism in uremia adohcy sulfate and DMG currently are being investigated as retained solutes that can inhibit or more pathways of hcy metabolism in addition the high hcy levels decrease in malnourished endstage renal disease patients and change according to nutrient NI and several other nutritional parameters indicating that circulating hcy C2 become an expression of nutritional status

VPI,velopharyngeal insufficiency,EXT,thirty consecutive patients with clinical manifestations of VP insufficiency were evaluated by the radiographic techniques of mm lateral stills and lateral cinefluorography the purpose of this T0 was to make retrospective comparisons between the actual decisions on VP competency or incompetency which were originally made on the basis of cinefluorographic findings with those which we believe would have been made from that information obtained from lateral stills alone had the lateral stills been the only radiographic information available the results of the comparison between the two techniques suggests that one is apt to misdiagnose the presence or absence of VPI on the order of of th time when relying on the lateral still xray technique CT we attribute this potential error rate to the very limited speech sample that can be employed with the lateral still technique with the increasing number of AA procedures available for treating vp dysfunction it is our opinion that cine or videofluoroscopy allows the clinician to examine additional aspects of the patients palatal function that are as important in the final management decision as simply the ID of closure or the lack of closure of the velopharyngeal sphincter

S1,myosin,EXT,myosins are key components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton providing motility for a broad diversity of cargoes therefore understanding the origin and evolutionary history of myosin classes is crucial to address the evolution of eukaryote cell biology here we revise the classification of myosins using an updated taxon sampling that includes newly or recently sequenced genomes and transcriptomes from key taxa we performed a survey of eukaryotic genomes and phylogenetic analyses of the S1 gene family reconstructing the S1 toolkit at different key nodes in the eukaryotic tree of life we also identified the phylogenetic distribution of S1 diversity in terms of number of genes associated protein domains and number of classes in each taxa our analyses show that new classes ie paralogs and domain architectures were continuously generated throughout eukaryote evolution with a significant expansion of S1 abundance and domain architectural diversity at the stem of holozoa predating the origin of animal multicellularity indeed singlecelled holozoans have the most complex S1 complement among eukaryotes with paralogs of most myosins previously considered animal TPS we recover a dynamic evolutionary history with several lineagespecific expansions eg the myosin iiilike gene family diversification in choanoflagellates convergence in protein domain architectures eg fungal and animal chitin synthase myosins and important secondary losses overall our evolutionary scheme demonstrates that the ancestral eukaryote likely had a complex S1 repertoire that included six genes with different protein domain architectures finally we provide an integrative and robust classification useful for future genomic and PET studies on this crucial eukaryotic gene family

BF,basal forebrain,EXT,understanding the control of sleepwake states by the basal forebrain bf poses a challenge due to the intermingled presence of cholinergic gabaergic and glutamatergic SN all three bf neuronal subtypes project to the SC and are implicated in cortical arousal and sleepwake control thus nonspecific stimulation or inhibition studies do not reveal the roles of these different neuronal types recent studies using optogenetics have shown that selective stimulation of bf ACh neurons increases transitions between nrem sleep and wakefulness implicating ACh projections to cortex in wake promotion however the interpretation of these optogenetic experiments is complicated by interactions that may occur within the bf for instance a recent in vitro study from our group found that cholinergic SN strongly excite neighboring gabaergic SN including the subset of cortically projecting SN which contain the calciumbinding protein parvalbumin pv yang et al thus the wakepromoting effect of selective optogenetic stimulation of bf ACh neurons could be mediated by local excitation of gabapv or other noncholinergic bf neurons in this T0 using a newly designed optodialysis probe to couple selective optical stimulation with simultaneous in vivo MD we demonstrated that optical stimulation of ACh neurons locally increased acetylcholine levels and increased wakefulness in mice surprisingly the enhanced wakefulness caused by cholinergic stimulation was abolished by simultaneous reverse microdialysis of cholinergic receptor antagonists into bf thus our data suggest that the wakepromoting effect of ACh stimulation requires local release of acetylcholine in the BF and activation of cortically projecting noncholinergic SN including the gabaergicpv SN

DR,drug resistance,EXT,the evolution of drug resistant bacteria is a severe public health problem both in hospitals and in the community currently some countries aim at concentrating highly specialized services in large hospitals in order to improve patient outcomes emergent resistant strains often originate in health care facilities but it is unknown to what extent hospital size affects resistance evolution and the resulting spillover of hospitalassociated pathogens to the community we used two published datasets from the us and ireland to investigate the effects of hospital size and controlled for several confounders such as antimicrobial usage sampling frequency mortality disinfection and length of stay the proportion of patients acquiring both sensitive and resistant infections in a hospital strongly correlated with hospital size moreover we observe the same DP for both the percentage of resistant infections and the increase of hospitalacquired infections over time one interpretation of this DP is that chance effects in small hospitals impede the spread of drugresistance to investigate to what extent the size distribution of hospitals can directly affect the prevalence of antibiotic resistance we use a stochastic epidemiological MM describing the spread of drug resistance in a hospital setting as well as the interaction between one or several hospitals and the community we show that the level of DR typically increases with population size in small hospitals chance effects cause C1 fluctuations in pathogen population size or even extinctions both of which impede the acquisition and spread of DR finally we show that indirect transmission via environmental reservoirs can reduce the effect of hospital size because the slow turnover in the environment can prevent extinction of resistant strains this implies that reducing environmental transmission is especially important in small hospitals because such a reduction not only reduces overall transmission but might also facilitate the extinction of resistant strains overall our T0 shows that the CSD of hospital sizes is a crucial factor for the spread of DR

RI,renal insufficiency,EXT,although convertingenzyme inhibition is of established value in the management of patients with severe chronic congestive HR failure troublesome adverse reactions occur frequently during the course of treatment and may cause physicians to interrupt ERP therapy the three most common adverse reactions that are seen in patients with HF following treatment with captopril and enalapril symptomatic SH PET RI hyperkalaemia are predictable consequences of interfering with the homeostatic functions of the reninangiotensin system which evolved millions of years ago to preserve life in sodiumdepleted states it is not surprising therefore that these untoward effects can be prevented or reversed by increasing the dietary NI of salt or reducing the dose of concomitantly administered diuretics their occurrence rarely requires discontinuation of drug therapy recognition of this link between sodium balance and the adverse effects of convertingenzyme inhibition is important because most patients with severe HR failure who experience such untoward reactions can nevertheless be expected to improve clinically during longterm therapy if effective treatment is not interrupted

L1,first language,EXT,bilinguals have been shown to be less susceptible to stroop interference in their L1 than monolinguals though the cause is currently being debated in two experiments we explored how cognitive control and word recognition contribute to the stroop effect by contrasting cognitive control via a simon arrow task word recognition speed via a chineseenglish word recognition task and stroop susceptibility via a verbal stroop task between proficient and nonproficient chineseenglish bilinguals compared to nonproficient bilinguals proficient bilinguals showed better cognitive control at inhibiting irrelevant information and they were slower at recognising chinese words but quicker at recognising english words critically we also showed that proficient bilinguals showed a smaller stroop effect than nonproficient bilinguals in chinese but a comparable stroop effect as nonproficient bilinguals in english the results cannot be accounted for by cognitive control or word recognition speed CT instead they are best accommodated by assuming that cognitive control and word recognition speed jointly determine the stroop effect thus we conclude that enhanced cognitive control and delayed word recognition combine to reduce stroop effect in bilinguals as compared to monolinguals

OM,outer medulla,EXT,chronic potassium loading results in an increased capacity of the distal nephron to secrete potassium the cellular mechanism for this adaptation has been correlated to an increase in the activity of sodiumpotassiumatpase because adaptation may be dependent on the greater availability of potassium pumps in the basolateral membrane a stereologic analysis of the membrane SA was performed to determine whether the apparent increase in pump CS was due to an increase in cell membrane surface with potssium adaptation the number of microplicated cells in the OM was reduced from to there was a marked increase in the basolateral infolding of principal cells and membrane surface increased by in papillary collecting duct cells the basolateral membrane surface was unchanged but the surface density of the luminal membrane increased by these observations suggest that amplification of the basolateral cell membrane to increase the number of potassium pump CS per cell plays an important role in the mechanism of potassium adaptation in the outer medulla a different mechanism involving the luminal membrane operates in the PTC collecting duct structural alterations in cell membrane surfaces are thus related to the regulation of the epithelial transport of electrolytes

TRIM,tripartite motif,EXT,TN factor related apoptosisinducing ligand trail is a highly promising therapeutic agent for CA treatment owing to its ability to selectively target tumor cells for cell death while having little effect on most normal cells however recent research has found that many cancers including nonsmall cell LC nsclc display resistance to trail therefore it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing the resistance of tumor cells to trail treatment in this T0 we show that gskÎ² antagonized trailinduced apoptosis in h nsclc cells and determined that the pkcÎ± isozyme is an upstream regulator of gskÎ² that phosphorylates and inactivates gskÎ² thereby sensitizing cancer cells to trailinduced apoptosis furthermore we demonstrated that the Bcl-2 effect of gskÎ² is mediated by the nfÎºb pathway whereas the TRIM trim was able to inhibit the activation of nfÎºb by gskÎ² and leads to the promotion of cell apoptosis taken together our study further delineated the underpinning mechanism of resistance to trailinduced apoptosis in h cells and provided new clues for sensitizing nsclc cells to trail therapy

CTS,circadian timing system,EXT,the female reproductive cycle is gated by the CTS and may be vulnerable to disruptions in the circadian system prior work suggests that VIP vipexpressing SN in the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn are one pathway by which the circadian clock can influence the estrous cycle but the impact of the loss of this peptide on reproduction has not been assessed in the present study we first examine the impact of the genetic loss of the neuropeptide vip on the reproductive success of female mice significantly mutant females produce about half the offspring of their wildtype sisters even when mated to the same males we also find that vipdeficient females exhibit a disrupted estrous cycle that is ovulation occurs less frequently and results in the PR of fewer oocytes compared with controls circadian rhythms of wheelrunning activity are disrupted in the female mutant mice as is the SEA of dorsal scn SN on a molecular level the vipdeficient scn tissue exhibits lower amplitude oscillations with altered phase relationships between the scn and peripheral oscillators as measured by perdriven bioluminescence the simplest explanation of our data is that the loss of vip results in a weakened scn FEO which reduces the synchronization of the female circadian system these results clarify one of the mechanisms by which disruption of the circadian system reduces female reproductive success

CMS,chronic mild stress,EXT,our previous T0 demonstrated that gypenosides produced antidepressantlike effects in mice exposed to CMS in a brainderived neurotrophic factordependent manner however whether other mechanisms are involved in the antidepressantlike effects of gypenosides is not clear mir is one of the most abundant micrornas in the hippocampus and its dysregulation is related to the pathophysiology of depression the glucocorticoid receptor is dysfunctional in depression and it is a direct target of mir therefore the present study used corticosteroneinduced mice as a model to evaluate the role of mir on the antidepressantlike effects of gypenosides mir agomir was intracerebrally injected prior to administration of gypenosides and corticosterone i.t. sucrose preference and forced swimming tests were performed days later proteins related to glucocorticoid receptors and brainderived neurotrophic factortyrosine receptor kinase b signaling in the hippocampus were evaluated our results demonstrated that gypenosides reversed the chronic corticosterone injectioninduced decreased SU preference and increased immobility time in contrast this effect was antagonized by mir i.t. in addition gypenosides increased glucocorticoid receptor and TrkB expression in the hippocampus which G1 brainderived neurotrophic factor signaling mir also blocked these effects in conclusion this T0 demonstrated that a reduction in mir was required for the antidepressantlike effects of gypenosides induced by chronic corticosterone i.t. in mice

NT,neural tube,EXT,several fundamental questions relating to the PSA basis of megaloblastic hemopoiesis in vitamin b b and folate deficiency and neurological damage in b deficiency remain to be answered among them is the explanation underlying the failure of bdeficient animals to develop megaloblastic hemopoiesis despite indirect evidence of impaired thymidylate synthesis and the inverse relationship between the extent of hematologic and neurological damage in b deficiency diagnostic advances have led to the awareness that many patients with b or folate deficiency are hematologically normal and that subtle hematologic or NP manifestations may be found at a fairly early stage of developing b deficiency studies of the mechanism of absorption of b in food have identified the syndrome of food b malabsorption in which the degree of b deficiency is commonly although not invariably mild folate NI influences the prevalence of NT defects ntds and a suboptimal folate status may be associated with an increased risk for dysplasia and CA the latter may be at least partly the result of uracil misincorporation into dna and consequent dna strand breaks folate status has also been linked to arteriosclerotic AVD through its effect on SS homocysteine levels uracil misincorporation into dna and increased serum homocysteine C2 may also be found in b deficiency these adverse associations form the basis of a case for improving b or folate status in individuals with a mild degree of deficiency because inadequate folate NI is relatively common especially in the elderly and the poor the fortification of staple foods with folate is currently under AS consideration

ADT,androgen deprivation therapy,EXT,most advanced prostate cancers pca will develop into the castrationresistant stage following ADT yet the molecular mechanisms remain unclear in this T0 we found prlz a newly identified prostate leucine zipper gene that is highly expressed in pca could interact with the androgen receptor ar directly leading to enhance ar TA in the castrationresistant condition prlz might enhance ar transactivation via a change of ar conformation that leads to promotion of ar nuclear translocation and suppression of ar Kd via modulating the proteasome pathway which resulted in increased prostatespecific antigen expression and promoted pca growth at the castrationresistant stage clinical pca sample survey from samepatient paired specimens found increased prlz expression in castrationresistant pca following the CP ADT targeting the arprlz complex via ascjÂ® or prlzsirna resulted in suppression of pca growth in various human pca cells and in vivo mouse pca models together these data not only strengthen prlz roles in the transition from androgen dependence to androgen independence during the castrationresistant stage but they may also provide a new potential therapy to battle pca at the castrationresistant stage

ca,constitutively activated,EXT,activation of the heatshock or stress response is generally considered a cytoprotective response to heat or other proteotoxic stresses in mammalian cells stressinduced transcription of heatshock genes is regulated by heatshock transcription factor hsf we now show that activation of the fas death receptor transactivates hsf in hela cells a fasexpressing CC line whereas hsf is constitutively expressed in a nondnabinding transcriptionally inactive state activation of fas leads to enhanced transcription of a heatshock reporter gene the effects of fas on heatshockgene transcription do not appear to be a consequence of cell death as they precede apoptotic changes and are not abrogated by yvadcmk an inhibitor of fas apoptosis that acts by blocking downstream effector PRs despite expressing fas hela cells are relatively insensitive to fasmediated killing indicating that fas expression alone although necessary is not sufficient for apoptosis by overexpressing a ca form of hsf we sensitize hela cells to fasmediated killing these findings shed new light on the interaction between two of the most evolutionarily conserved cell programs in nature the fas death pathway and the heatshock response strategies designed to upregulate hsf in RT cells either through pharmacologic or genetherapy approaches will hopefully provide a means with which to sensitize tumors to the killing effects of CA therapies operating through the fas receptor

IE,information extraction,EXT,"Hence , IE technology is used to build various citation building systems such as Citeseer , Google Scholar , DBLP , Scopus , Thomson Reuter , etc ."
OCM,oz computation model,EXT,The OCM defines formal operational semantics and an abstract machine that specify exactly how to execute a kernel language program .
RWA,recurrent weighted average,EXT,"Because the RWA can be computed as a running average , the computational overhead scales like that of any other RNN architecture ."
SW,sliding window,EXT,"The SW tagger could not make use of forbid and enforce rules because of the fact that it works with ambiguity classes , while on the other hand , the LSW tagger can easily incorporate them as it works directly with PoS tagsThe rules can be introduced right after the initialization step ."
EL,euler - lagrange,EXT,"ASRC does not require any knowledge of the systems dynamics terms , and of WMR system ( 57 ) ( and for the matter of fact any EL system representing dynamics ( 3 ) ) ."
SPF,shortest path forest,EXT,Now we describe the second part of the SPF - A algorithm and show that it requires rounds and messages .
ID,interleaved declustering,EXT,For ID is equivalent to BM .
