TF,term frequency,EXT,"In information retrieval, tf–idf or TFIDF, short for TF–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus."
TF,term frequency,EXT,"To further distinguish them, we might count the number of times each term occurs in each document; the number of times a term occurs in a document is called its TF."
TF,term frequency,EXT,The weight of a term that occurs in a document is simply proportional to the TF.
TF,term frequency,EXT,"Because the term ""the"" is so common, TF will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word ""the"" more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms ""brown"" and ""cow""."
TF,term frequency,EXT,"The tf–idf is the product of two statistics, TF and inverse document frequency."
TF,term frequency,EXT,"In the case of the TF tf, the simplest choice is to use the raw count of a term in a document, i.e., the number of times that term t occurs in document d."
TF,term frequency,EXT,"if t occurs in d and 0 otherwise;

TF,term frequency,EXT,A high weight in tf–idf is reached by a high TF  and a low document frequency of the term in the whole collection of documents; the weights hence tend to filter out common terms.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"In molecular biology, a TF   is a protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA, by binding to a specific DNA sequence."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"The number of TFs found within an organism increases with genome size, and larger genomes tend to have more TFs per gene."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"There are approximately 2800 proteins in the human genome that contain DNA-binding domains, and 1600 of these are presumed to function as TFs, though other studies indicate it to be a smaller number."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Therefore, approximately 10% of genes in the genome code for TFs, which makes this family the single largest family of human proteins."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Furthermore, genes are often flanked by several binding sites for distinct TFs, and efficient expression of each of these genes requires the cooperative action of several different TFs ."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Hence, the combinatorial use of a subset of the approximately 2000 human TFs easily accounts for the unique regulation of each gene in the human genome during development."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Depending on the TF, the transcription of the adjacent gene is either up- or down-regulated."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,The TF can either do this directly or recruit other proteins with this catalytic activity.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Many TFs use one or the other of two opposing mechanisms to regulate transcription:histone acetyltransferase  activity – acetylates histone proteins, which weakens the association of DNA with histones, which make the DNA more accessible to transcription, thereby up-regulating transcription"
TF,transcription factor,EXT,recruit coactivator or corepressor proteins to the TF
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Below are some of the important functions and biological roles TFs are involved in:


==="
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"In eukaryotes, an important class of TFs called general TFs  are necessary for transcription to occur."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Other TFs differentially regulate the expression of various genes by binding to enhancer regions of DNA adjacent to regulated genes.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"These TFs are critical to making sure that genes are expressed in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount, depending on the changing requirements of the organism."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Many TFs in multicellular organisms are involved in development.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Responding to stimuli, these TFs turn on/off the transcription of the appropriate genes, which, in turn, allows for changes in cell morphology or activities needed for cell fate determination and cellular differentiation."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"The Hox TF family, for example, is important for proper body pattern formation in organisms as diverse as fruit flies to humans."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Another example is the TF encoded by the sex-determining region Y  gene, which plays a major role in determining sex in humans."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"If the signal requires upregulation or downregulation of genes in the recipient cell, often TFs will be downstream in the signaling cascade."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Estrogen signaling is an example of a fairly short signaling cascade that involves the estrogen receptor TF:
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Not only do TFs act downstream of signaling cascades related to biological stimuli but they can also be downstream of signaling cascades involved in environmental stimuli.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Many TFs, especially some that are proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors, help regulate the cell cycle and as such determine how large a cell will get and when it can divide into two daughter cells."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,This is also true with TFs:  Not only do TFs control the rates of transcription to regulate the amounts of gene products  available to the cell but TFs themselves are regulated .
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Below is a brief synopsis of some of the ways that the activity of TFs can be regulated:


="
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Any of these steps can be regulated to affect the production  of a TF.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,An implication of this is that TFs can regulate themselves.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"For example, in a negative feedback loop, the TF acts as its own repressor:  If the TF protein binds the DNA of its own gene, it down-regulates the production of more of itself."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,This is one mechanism to maintain low levels of a TF in a cell.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"In eukaryotes, TFs  are transcribed in the nucleus but are then translated in the cell's cytoplasm."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"But, for many TFs, this is a key point in their regulation."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Important classes of TFs such as some nuclear receptors must first bind a ligand while in the cytoplasm before they can relocate to the nucleus.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"==
Transcription factors may be activated  through their signal-sensing domain by a number of mechanisms including:

ligand binding – Not only is ligand binding able to influence where a TF is located within a cell but ligand binding can also affect whether the TF is in an active state and capable of binding DNA or other cofactors ."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Many TFs such as STAT proteins must be phosphorylated before they can bind DNA.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,interaction with other TFs  or coregulatory proteins
TF,transcription factor,EXT,DNA within nucleosomes is inaccessible to many TFs.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Some TFs, so-called pioneer factors are still able to bind their DNA binding sites on the nucleosomal DNA."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"For most other TFs, the nucleosome should be actively unwound by molecular motors such as chromatin remodelers."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Alternatively, the nucleosome can be partially unwrapped by thermal fluctuations, allowing temporary access to the TF binding site."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"In many cases, a TF needs to compete for binding to its DNA binding site with other TFs and histones or non-histone chromatin proteins."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Pairs of TFs and other proteins can play antagonistic roles  in the regulation of the same gene.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Availability of other cofactors/TFs
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Most TFs do not work alone.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"For gene transcription to occur, a number of TFs must bind to DNA regulatory sequences."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"This collection of TFs, in turn, recruit intermediary proteins such as cofactors that allow efficient recruitment of the preinitiation complex and RNA polymerase."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Thus, for a single TF to initiate transcription, all of these other proteins must also be present, and the TF must be in a state where it can bind to them if necessary."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Cofactors are proteins that modulate the effects of TFs.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,The DNA binding sites of 519 TFs were evaluated.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Of these, 169 TFs  did not have CpG dinucleotides in their binding sites, and 33 TFs  could bind to a CpG-containing motif but did not display a preference for a binding site with either a methylated or unmethylated"
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"There were 117 TFs  that were inhibited from binding to their binding sequence if it contained a methylated CpG site, 175 TFs  that had enhanced binding if their binding sequence had a methylated CpG site, and 25 TFs  were either inhibited or had enhanced binding depending on where in the binding sequence the methylated CpG was located."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Multiple TFs important in cell differentiation and lineage specification, including NANOG, SALL4A, WT1, EBF1, PU.1, and E2A, have been shown to recruit TET enzymes to specific genomic loci  to act on methylcytosine  and convert it to hydroxymethylcytosine hmC ."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"TET-mediated conversion of mC to hmC appears to disrupt the binding of 5mC-binding proteins including MECP2 and MBD  proteins, facilitating nucleosome remodeling and the binding of TFs, thereby activating transcription of those genes."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,EGR1 is an important TF in memory formation.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,The TF EGR1 recruits the TET1 protein that initiates a pathway of DNA demethylation.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,DNA sequences that bind TFs are often referred to as response elements.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,The portion  of the TF that binds DNA is called its DNA-binding domain.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Below is a partial list of some of the major families of DNA-binding domains/TFs:


="
TF,transcription factor,EXT,The DNA sequence that a TF binds to is called a TF-binding site or response element.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Due to the nature of these chemical interactions, most TFs bind DNA in a sequence specific manner."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"However, not all bases in the TF-binding site may actually interact with the TF."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Thus, TFs do not bind just one sequence but are capable of binding a subset of closely related sequences, each with a different strength of interaction."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"For example, although the consensus binding site for the TATA-binding protein  is TATAAAA, the TBP TF can also bind similar sequences such as TATATAT or TATATAA."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Because TFs can bind a set of related sequences and these sequences tend to be short, potential TF binding sites can occur by chance if the DNA sequence is long enough."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"It is unlikely, however, that a TF will bind all compatible sequences in the genome of the cell."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Other constraints, such as DNA accessibility in the cell or availability of cofactors may also help dictate where a TF will actually bind."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Thus, given the genome sequence it is still difficult to predict where a TF will actually bind in a living cell."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Due to their important roles in development, intercellular signaling, and cell cycle, some human diseases have been associated with mutations in TFs."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Many TFs are either tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and, thus, mutations or aberrant regulation of them is associated with cancer."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Three groups of TFs are known to be important in human cancer: 
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Approximately 10% of currently prescribed drugs directly target the nuclear receptor class of TFs.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"In addition, TFs are often indirectly modulated by drugs through signaling cascades."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,It might be possible to directly target other less-explored TFs such as NF-κB with drugs.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,This applies particularly to TFs.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"However, changes of the DNA binding specificities of the single-copy LEAFY TF, which occurs in most land plants, have recently been elucidated."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"In that respect, a single-copy TF can undergo a change of specificity through a promiscuous intermediate without losing function."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"Similar mechanisms have been proposed in the context of all alternative phylogenetic hypotheses, and the role of TFs in the evolution of all species."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,There are different technologies available to analyze TFs.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"On the genomic level, DNA-sequencing and database research are commonly used The protein version of the TF is detectable by using specific antibodies."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"By using electrophoretic mobility shift assay , the activation profile of TFs can be detected."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,A multiplex approach for activation profiling is a TF chip system where several different TFs can be detected in parallel.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,The most commonly used method for identifying TF binding sites is chromatin immunoprecipitation .
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"This technique relies on chemical fixation of chromatin with formaldehyde, followed by co-precipitation of DNA and the TF of interest using an antibody that specifically targets that protein."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,The DNA sequences can then be identified by microarray or high-throughput sequencing  to determine TF binding sites.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"As described in more detail below, TFs may be classified by their  mechanism of action,  regulatory function, or "
TF,transcription factor,EXT,There are two mechanistic classes of TFs:
TF,transcription factor,EXT,General TFs are involved in the formation of a preinitiation complex.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,Upstream TFs are proteins that bind somewhere upstream of the initiation site to stimulate or repress transcription.
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"These are roughly synonymous with specific TFs, because they vary considerably depending on what recognition sequences are present in the proximity of the gene."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"===
Transcription factors have been classified according to their regulatory function:
I. constitutively active – present in all cells at all times – general TFs, Sp1, NF1, CCAAT
II."
TF,transcription factor,EXT,"II.B.3 cell membrane receptor-dependent – second messenger signaling cascades resulting in the phosphorylation of the TF
II.B.3.a resident nuclear factors – reside in the nucleus regardless of activation state – CREB, AP-1, Mef2
II.B.3.b latent cytoplasmic factors – inactive form reside in the cytoplasm, but, when activated, are translocated into the nucleus – STAT, R-SMAD, NF-κB, Notch, TUBBY, NFAT

BN,batch normalization,EXT,"However, at initialization, BN in fact induces severe gradient explosion in deep networks, which is only alleviated by skip connections in residual networks."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Others sustain that BN achieves length-direction decoupling, and thereby accelerates neural networks."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Therefore, the method of BN is proposed to reduce these unwanted shifts to speed up training and to produce more reliable models."

BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Furthermore, BN seems to have a regularizing effect such that the network improves its generalization properties, and it is thus unnecessary to use dropout to mitigate overfitting."

BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Formally, the operation that implements BN is a transform

BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Since the parameters are fixed in this transformation, the BN procedure is essentially applying a linear transform to the activation."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Although BN has become a popular method due to its strengths, the working mechanism of the method is not yet well-understood."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Scholars show that internal covariate shift is not reduced significantly by BN, despite of common belief."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,The correlation between BN and internal covariate shift is widely accepted but was not supported by experimental results.
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Rather, the enhanced accuracy with the BN layer seems to be independent of internal covariate shift."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Specifically, three models are trained and compared: a standard VGG network without BN, a VGG network with BN layers, and a VGG network with BN layers and random noise."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,It is then added after the BN layers to deliberately introduce covariate shift into activation.
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"While the internal covariate shifts are larger at all levels, the model with BN still performs better than the standard VGG model."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,It could thus be concluded that internal covariate shift might not be the contributing factor of the performance of BN.
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Since it is hypothesized that BN layers could reduce internal covariate shift, an experiment is set up to measure quantitatively how much covariate shift is reduced."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"The correlation between the gradients are computed for four models: a standard VGG network, a VGG network with BN layers, a 25-layer deep linear network  trained with full-batch gradient descent, and a DLN network with BN layers."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Interestingly, it is shown that the standard VGG and DLN models both have higher correlations of gradients compared with their counterparts, indicating that the additional BN layers are not reducing internal covariate shift."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Some scholars proposed and proved that BN could introduce greater Lipschitzness into the loss and the gradient during training, and that this improved smoothness could explain its great performance."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"These effects can be observed by comparing VGG networks trained with and without BN, and is also consistent among other networks, such as linear deep networks."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,This two-way relationship could thus indicate that smoothness of the optimization landscape could be a contributing factor to the superior performance of BN.
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Besides analyzing this correlation experimentally, theoretical analysis is also provided for verification that BN could result in a smoother landscape."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Consider two identical networks, one contains BN layers and the other doesn't, the behaviors of these two networks are then compared."

BN,batch normalization,EXT,It could thus be concluded from this inequality that the gradient generally becomes more predictive with the BN layer.
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"In addition to the smoother landscape, it is further shown that BN could result in a better initialization with the following inequality:"
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"Some scholars argue that the above analysis cannot fully capture the performance of BN, because the proof only concerns the largest eigenvalue, or equivalently, one direction in the landscape at all points."
BN,batch normalization,EXT,It is argued that the success of BN could be at least partially credited to the length-direction decoupling effect that the method provides.
BN,batch normalization,EXT,"By interpreting the BN procedure as the reparametrization of weight space, it could be shown that the length and the direction of the weights are separated after the procedure, and they could thus be trained separately."

CA,current account,EXT,"In the traditional accounting of balance of payments, the CA equals the change in net foreign assets."
CA,current account,EXT,A CA deficit implies a reduction of net foreign assets:
CA,current account,EXT,"If an economy is running a CA deficit, it is absorbing "
CA,current account,EXT,"On the other hand, if an economy is running a CA surplus it is absorbing less than that it is producing."
CA,current account,EXT,"Normally, the CA is calculated by adding up the 4 components of CA: goods, services, income and current transfers."
CA,current account,EXT,"In calculating CA, exports are marked as credit  and imports as debit ."
CA,current account,EXT,"A country's CA can be calculated by the following formula:

  
    
      
        C
        A"
CA,current account,EXT,"Where CA is the CA, X and M are respectively the export and import of goods and services, NY the net income from abroad, and NCT the net current transfers."
CA,current account,EXT,Reducing CA deficits ==
CA,current account,EXT,"A nation's CA balance is influenced by numerous factors – its trade policies, exchange rate, competitiveness, forex reserves, inflation rate and others."
CA,current account,EXT,"Since the trade balance  is generally the biggest determinant of the CA surplus or deficit, the CA balance often displays a cyclical trend."
CA,current account,EXT,"During a strong economic expansion, import volumes typically surge; if exports are unable to grow at the same rate, the CA deficit will widen."
CA,current account,EXT,"Conversely, during a recession, the CA deficit will shrink if imports decline and exports increase to stronger economies."
CA,current account,EXT,"The currency exchange rate exerts a significant influence on the trade balance, and by extension, on the CA."
CA,current account,EXT,"An overvalued currency makes imports cheaper and exports less competitive, thereby widening the CA deficit ."
CA,current account,EXT,"An undervalued currency, on the other hand, boosts exports and makes imports more expensive, thus increasing the CA surplus ."
CA,current account,EXT,Nations with chronic CA deficits often come under increased investor scrutiny during periods of heightened uncertainty.
CA,current account,EXT,Action to reduce a substantial CA deficit usually involves increasing exports  or decreasing imports .
CA,current account,EXT,"Less obvious methods to reduce a CA deficit include measures that increase domestic savings , including a reduction in borrowing by the national government."
CA,current account,EXT,A CA deficit is not always a problem.
CA,current account,EXT,The Pitchford thesis states that a CA deficit does not matter if it is driven by the private sector.
CA,current account,EXT,"It is also known as the ""consenting adults"" view of the CA, as it holds that deficits are not a problem if they result from private sector agents engaging in mutually beneficial trade."
CA,current account,EXT,"A CA deficit creates an obligation of repayments of foreign capital, and that capital consists of many individual transactions."
CA,current account,EXT,"To be more precise, the CA equals:"
CA,current account,EXT,The CA is essentially exports – imports 
CA,current account,EXT,"If one has a CA deficit, in a floating exchange rate this must be balanced by a surplus on the financial / capital account."
CA,current account,EXT,"Within the BOP there are three separate categories under which different transactions are categorized: the CA, the capital account and the financial account."
CA,current account,EXT,"In the CA, goods, services, income and current transfers are recorded."
CA,current account,EXT,"Absent changes in official reserves, the CA is the mirror image of the sum of the capital and financial accounts."
CA,current account,EXT,One might then ask: Is the CA driven by the capital and financial accounts or is it vice versa?
CA,current account,EXT,"The traditional response is that the CA is the main causal factor, with capital and financial accounts simply reflecting financing of a deficit or investment of funds arising as a result of a surplus."
CA,current account,EXT,"In particular, it has controversially been suggested that the United States CA deficit is driven by the desire of international investors to acquire US assets ."
CA,current account,EXT,"However, the main viewpoint undoubtedly remains that the causative factor is the CA and that the positive financial account reflects the need to finance the country's CA deficit."
CA,current account,EXT,"Current account surpluses are facing CA deficits of other countries, the indebtedness of which towards abroad therefore increases."
CA,current account,EXT,"The existing differences between the CAs in the eurozone is considered to be the root cause of the Euro crisis by many Keynesian economists, such as Yanis Varoufakis, Heiner Flassbeck, Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz."
CA,current account,EXT,"Since 1989, the CA deficit of the US has been increasingly large, reaching close to 7% of the GDP in 2006."
CA,current account,EXT,"New evidence, however, suggests that the US CA deficits are being mitigated by positive valuation effects."
CA,current account,EXT,The net foreign assets of the US are therefore not deteriorating one to one with the CA deficits.
CA,current account,EXT,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD – an international economic organisation of 34 countries, founded in 1961 to ""promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world"" – produces quarterly reports on its 34 member nations comparing statistics on balance of payments and international trade in terms of CA balance in billions of US dollars and as a percentage of GDP.For example,"
CA,current account,EXT,"according to their report the CA balance in billions of US dollars of several countries can be compared,

CA,combinatorial auction,EXT,"Simple CAs have been used for many years in estate auctions, where a common procedure is to accept bids for packages of items."
CA,combinatorial auction,EXT,"In recent years, procurement teams have applied reverse CAs in the procurement of goods and services."
CA,combinatorial auction,EXT,"Although they allow bidders to be more expressive, CAs present both computational and game-theoretic challenges compared to traditional auctions."
CA,combinatorial auction,EXT,"The winner determination problem can be stated as follows: given a set of bids in a CA, find an allocation of items to bidders—including the possibility that the auctioneer retains some items—that maximizes the auctioneer’s revenue."
CA,combinatorial auction,EXT,The CA problem can be modeled as a set packing problem.
CA,combinatorial auction,EXT,"Therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to find approximated solutions for CA problem."

CA,cellular automata,EXT,"A cellular automaton (pl. CA, abbrev."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"In the 1980s, Stephen Wolfram engaged in a systematic study of one-dimensional CA, or what he calls elementary CA; his research assistant Matthew Cook showed that one of these rules is Turing-complete."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"Wolfram published A New Kind of Science in 2002, claiming that CA have applications in many fields of science."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"The primary classifications of CA, as outlined by Wolfram, are numbered one to four."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"Special types of CA are reversible, where only a single configuration leads directly to a subsequent one, and totalistic, in which the future value of individual cells only depends on the total value of a group of neighboring cells."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,The latter assumption is common in one-dimensional CA.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,Thus was born the first system of CA.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"Like Ulam's lattice network, von Neumann's CA are two-dimensional, with his self-replicator implemented algorithmically."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"By the end of the 1950s it had been noted that CA could be viewed as parallel computers, and particularly in the 1960s a sequence of increasingly detailed and technical theorems—often analogous to ones about Turing machines—were proved about their formal computational capabilities."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"In the 1960s, CA were studied as a particular type of dynamical system and the connection with the mathematical field of symbolic dynamics was established for the first time."

CA,cellular automata,EXT,Stephen Wolfram independently began working on CA in mid-1981 after considering how complex patterns seemed formed in nature in violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,He published his first paper in Reviews of Modern Physics investigating elementary CA  in June 1983.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"His investigations, however, led him to realize that CA were poor at modelling neural networks."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"In 2002 Wolfram published a 1280-page text A New Kind of Science, which extensively argues that the discoveries about CA are not isolated facts but are robust and have significance for all disciplines of science."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"Despite confusion in the press, the book did not argue for a fundamental theory of physics based on CA, and although it did describe a few specific physical models based on CA, it also provided models based on qualitatively different abstract systems."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"Wolfram, in A New Kind of Science and several papers dating from the mid-1980s, defined four classes into which CA and several other simple computational models can be divided depending on their behavior."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"While earlier studies in CA tended to try to identify type of patterns for specific rules, Wolfram's classification was the first attempt to classify the rules themselves."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"Wolfram has conjectured that many class 4 CA, if not all, are capable of universal computation."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,And so it is with CA: there are occasionally rules...
CA,cellular automata,EXT,Wolfram's classification has been empirically matched to a clustering of the compressed lengths of the outputs of CA.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"There have been several attempts to classify CA in formally rigorous classes, inspired by the Wolfram's classification."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of CA."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"For CA in which not every configuration has a preimage, the configurations without preimages are called Garden of Eden patterns."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,For one-dimensional CA there are known algorithms for deciding whether a rule is reversible or irreversible.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"However, for CA of two or more dimensions reversibility is undecidable; that is, there is no algorithm that takes as input an automaton rule and is guaranteed to determine correctly whether the automaton is reversible."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"Reversible CA are often used to simulate such physical phenomena as gas and fluid dynamics, since they obey the laws of thermodynamics."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,Such CA have rules specially constructed to be reversible.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,Several techniques can be used to explicitly construct reversible CA with known inverses.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"Although such automata do not strictly satisfy the definition given above, it can be shown that they can be emulated by conventional CA with sufficiently large neighborhoods and numbers of states, and can therefore be considered a subset of conventional CA."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,A special class of CA are totalistic CA.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,Conway's Game of Life is an example of an outer totalistic cellular automaton with cell values 0 and 1; outer totalistic CA with the same Moore neighborhood structure as Life are sometimes called life-like CA.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,In many cases the resulting CA are equivalent to those with rectangular grids with specially designed neighborhoods and rules.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,Such CA are called probabilistic CA.
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"In CA, the new state of a cell is not affected by the new state of other cells."
CA,cellular automata,EXT,"These are like totalistic CA, but instead of the rule and states being discrete , continuous functions are used, and the states become continuous )."

RL,reinforcement learning,EXT,"The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process , because many RL algorithms for this context use dynamic programming techniques."

NP,noun phrase,EXT,"In some languages, including English, NPs are required to be ""completed"" with a determiner in many contexts, and thus a distinction is made in syntactic analysis between phrases that have received their required determiner , and those in which the determiner is lacking ."
NP,noun phrase,EXT,"The situation is complicated by the fact that in some contexts a NP may nonetheless be used without a determiner ; in this case the phrase may be described as having a ""null determiner""."
NP,noun phrase,EXT,"In the original X-bar theory, the two respective types of entity are called NP  and N-bar ."
NP,noun phrase,EXT,"Thus in the sentence Here is the big house, both house and big house are N-bars, while the big house is a NP."
NP,noun phrase,EXT,"In the sentence I like big houses, both houses and big houses are N-bars, but big houses also functions as a NP ."
NP,noun phrase,EXT,"In some modern theories of syntax, however, what are called ""NPs"" above are no longer considered to be headed by a noun, but by the determiner , and they are thus called determiner phrases  instead of NPs."
NP,noun phrase,EXT,This analysis of NPs is widely referred to as the DP hypothesis.
NP,noun phrase,EXT,"It has been the preferred analysis of NPs in the minimalist program from its start , though the arguments in its favor tend to be theory-internal."
NP,noun phrase,EXT,"Dependency grammars, for instance, almost all assume the traditional NP analysis of NPs."
NP,noun phrase,EXT,"For illustrations of different analyses of NPs depending on whether the DP hypothesis is rejected or accepted, see the next section."
NP,noun phrase,EXT,The representation of NPs using parse trees depends on the basic approach to syntactic structure adopted.
NP,noun phrase,EXT,The layered trees of many phrase structure grammars grant NPs an intricate structure that acknowledges a hierarchy of functional projections.
NP,noun phrase,EXT,"Dependency grammars, in contrast, since the basic architecture of dependency places a major limitation on the amount of structure that the theory can assume, produce simple, relatively flat structures for NPs."

CV,cross validation,EXT,"Similar to the k*l-fold CV, the training set is used for model fitting and the validation set is used for model evaluation for each of the hyperparameter sets."
CV,constant velocity,EXT,"The fact that it failed to maintain CV during rotation was recognized by Robert Hooke in the 17th century, who proposed the first CV joint, consisting of two Cardan joints offset by 90 degrees, so as to cancel out the velocity variations."

CV,constant velocity,EXT,"Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing CV rotation."
CV,constant velocity,EXT,Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true CV rotation.
CV,constant velocity,EXT,"The Thompson CV joint , also known as a Thompson coupling, assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft."
CV,constant velocity,EXT,"While the geometric configuration does not maintain CV for the control yoke that aligns the cardan joints, the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration."

CR,cognitive radio,EXT,Spectrum sharing: Spectrum sharing CR networks allow CR users to share the spectrum bands of the licensed-band users.
CR,cognitive radio,EXT,"However, the CR users have to restrict their transmit power so that the interference caused to the licensed-band users is kept below a certain threshold."

IF,intermediate frequency,EXT,The main reason for using an IF is to improve frequency selectivity.
IF,intermediate frequency,EXT,"A first IF may even be higher than the input signal, so that all undesired responses can be easily filtered out by a fixed-tuned RF stage."
IF,intermediate frequency,EXT,"An IF was first used in the superheterodyne radio receiver, invented by American scientist Major Edwin Armstrong in 1918, during World War I.  A member of the Signal Corps, Armstrong was building radio direction finding equipment to track German military signals at the then-very high frequencies of 500 to 3500 kHz."

SM,social media,EXT,Users create service-specific profiles for the site or app that are designed and maintained by the SM organization.
SM,social media,EXT,"In 2019, Merriam-Webster defined ""SM"" as ""forms of electronic communication  through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content ""

SM,social media,EXT,Mobile SM ===
SM,social media,EXT,Mobile SM refer to the use of SM on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.
SM,social media,EXT,"Mobile SM are a useful application of mobile marketing because the creation, exchange, and circulation of user-generated content can assist companies with marketing research, communication, and relationship development."
SM,social media,EXT,Mobile SM differ from others because they incorporate the current location of the user  or the time delay between sending and receiving messages .
SM,social media,EXT,"According to Andreas Kaplan, mobile SM applications can be differentiated among four types:"
SM,social media,EXT,"Quick-timers : Transfer of traditional SM mobile apps to increase immediacy 
Slow-timers : Transfer of traditional SM applications to mobile devices 


== Elements and function ="
SM,social media,EXT,Some SM sites have the potential for content posted there to spread virally over social networks.
SM,social media,EXT,"In a SM context, content or websites that are ""viral""  are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted  to their social network, leading to further sharing."
SM,social media,EXT,"Many SM sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as Twitter's retweet button, Pinterest's pin function, Facebook's share option, or Tumblr's reblog function."
SM,social media,EXT,Nonprofit organizations and activists may have similar interests in posting content on SM sites with the aim of it going viral.
SM,social media,EXT,"Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout SM."
SM,social media,EXT,Internet bots have been developed which facilitate SM marketing.
SM,social media,EXT,"Chatbots and social bots are programmed to mimic natural human interactions such as liking, commenting, following, and unfollowing on SM platforms."
SM,social media,EXT,"Some bots are negatively affecting their marketing data causing a ""digital cannibalism"" in SM marketing."
SM,social media,EXT,Patents of SM technology
SM,social media,EXT,"===

There has been rapid growth in the number of U.S. patent applications that cover new technologies related to SM, and the number of them that are published has been growing rapidly over the past five years."
SM,social media,EXT,"According to Statista, in 2020, it is estimated that there are around 3.6 billion people using SM around the globe, up from 3.4 billion in 2019."
SM,social media,EXT,"According to a survey conducted by Pew Research in 2018, Facebook and YouTube dominated the SM landscape, as notable majorities of U.S. adults used each of these sites."
SM,social media,EXT,"A study from 2009 suggests that there may be individual differences that help explain who uses SM and who does not: Extraversion and openness have a positive relationship with SM, while emotional stability has a negative sloping relationship with SM."
SM,social media,EXT,A different study from 2015 found that people with a higher social comparison orientation appear to use SM more heavily than people with low social comparison orientation.
SM,social media,EXT,This is despite the fact that many SM sites have policies that state you must be at least 13-years-old or older to join.
SM,social media,EXT,"surveyed young Americans ages 8-16 and found that about 31% of children ages 8-12 ever use SM such as Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook."
SM,social media,EXT,"In that same survey, when American teens ages 16-18 were asked when they started using SM, 28% said they started to use it before they were 13-years-old."
SM,social media,EXT,"However, the median age of starting to use SM was 14-years-old."
SM,social media,EXT,surveyed Americans ages 9-12 found that the most popular SM site/app was YouTube .
SM,social media,EXT,"Similarly, a nationally representative survey by Common Sense Media conducted in 2020 of Americans ages 13-18 found that YouTube was also the most popular SM site/app ."
SM,social media,EXT,Governments may use SM to :
SM,social media,EXT,"The high distribution of SM in the private environment drives companies to deal with the application possibilities of SM on

customer-organizational level
and on intra-organizational level."
SM,social media,EXT,"Marketplace actors can use SM tools for marketing research, communication, sales promotions/discounts, informal employee-learning/organizational development, relationship development/loyalty programs, and e-Commerce."
SM,social media,EXT,Often SM can become a good source of information and/or explanation of industry trends for a business to embrace change.
SM,social media,EXT,"Trends in social-media technology and usage change rapidly, making it crucial for businesses to have a set of guidelines that can apply to many SM platforms."
SM,social media,EXT,"This can prove useful in public relations management and advertising-campaign tracking, allowing analysts to measure return on investment for their SM ad spending, competitor-auditing, and for public engagement."
SM,social media,EXT,Financial industries utilize the power of SM as a tool for analyzing the sentiment of financial markets.
SM,social media,EXT,"One of the foundation concepts in SM has become that one cannot completely control one's message through SM but rather one can simply begin to participate in the ""conversation"" expecting that one can achieve a significant influence in that conversation."
SM,social media,EXT,"The role of SM in democratizing media participation, which proponents herald as ushering in a new era of participatory democracy, with all users able to contribute news and comments, may fall short of the ideals, given that many often follow like-minded individuals, as noted by Philip Pond and Jeff Lewis."
SM,social media,EXT,Younger generations are becoming more involved in politics due to the increase of political news posted on SM.
SM,social media,EXT,Political campaigns are targeting Millennials online via SM posts in hope that they will increase their political engagement.
SM,social media,EXT,"However, there is debate about the extent to which SM facilitated this kind of political change."
SM,social media,EXT,The public has also increased their reliance on SM sites for political information.
SM,social media,EXT,"In the European Union, SM has amplified political messages."
SM,social media,EXT,One challenge is that militant groups have begun to see SM as a major organizing and recruiting tool.
SM,social media,EXT,"The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIL, ISIS, and Daesh, has used SM to promote its cause."
SM,social media,EXT,"Although phishing attacks via email are the most commonly used tactic to breach government networks, phishing attacks on SM rose 500% in 2016.Increasing political influence on SM saw several campaigns running from one political side against another."
SM,social media,EXT,Politicians themselves also use SM to their advantage and to spread their campaign messages and influence voters.
SM,social media,EXT,Some employers examine job applicants' SM profiles as part of the hiring assessment.
SM,social media,EXT,Many Western European countries have already implemented laws that restrict the regulation of SM in the workplace.
SM,social media,EXT,"States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin have passed legislation that protects potential employees and current employees from employers that demand that they provide their usernames and/or passwords for any SM accounts."
SM,social media,EXT,Use of SM by young people has caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on SM when they try to enter the job market.
SM,social media,EXT,"A survey of 17,000 young people in six countries in 2013 found that 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of online comments they made on SM websites."
SM,social media,EXT,"For potential employees, using SM publicly may alter shape patterns of deception in resumes."
SM,social media,EXT,There have been situations where students have been forced to give up their SM passwords to school administrators.
SM,social media,EXT,"There are inadequate laws to protect a student's SM privacy, and organizations such as the ACLU are pushing for more privacy protection, as it is an invasion."
SM,social media,EXT,"Before SM, admissions officials in the United States used SAT and other standardized test scores, extra-curricular activities, letters of recommendation, and high school report cards to determine whether to accept or deny an applicant."
SM,social media,EXT,"In the 2010s, while colleges and universities still use these traditional methods to evaluate applicants, these institutions are increasingly accessing applicants' SM profiles to learn about their character and activities."
SM,social media,EXT,"Students whose SM pages include offensive jokes or photos, racist or homophobic comments, photos depicting the applicant engaging in illegal drug use or drunkenness, and so on, may be screened out from admission processes."
SM,social media,EXT,"Police departments often make use of official SM accounts to engage with the public, publicize police activity, and burnish law enforcement's image; conversely, video footage of citizen-documented police brutality and other misconduct has sometimes been posted to SM."
SM,social media,EXT,"In the United States U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement identifies and track individuals via SM, and also has apprehended some people via SM based sting operations."
SM,social media,EXT,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection  and the United States Department of Homeland Security use SM data as influencing factors during the visa process, and continue to monitor individuals after they have entered the country."

SM,social media,EXT,"Judges are taking emojis into account to assess statements made on SM; in one Michigan case where a person alleged that another person had defamed them in an online comment, the judge disagreed, noting that there was an emoji after the comment which indicated that it was a joke."
SM,social media,EXT,Use by companies for SM marketing
SM,social media,EXT,Social media marketing is the use of SM platforms and websites to promote a product or service and also to establish a connection with its customers.
SM,social media,EXT,"Although the terms e-marketing and digital marketing are still dominant in academia, SM marketing is becoming more popular for both practitioners and researchers."
SM,social media,EXT,Social media marketing has increased due to the growing active user rates on SM sites.
SM,social media,EXT,"Users of SM are then able to like, share and comment on the advert, becoming message senders as they can keep passing the advert's message on to their friends and onwards."
SM,social media,EXT,The type of audience a business is going for will determine the SM site they use.
SM,social media,EXT,"Research shows that digital endorsements seem to be successfully targeting SM users, especially younger consumers who have grown up in the digital age."
SM,social media,EXT,The practice of harnessing SM personalities to market or promote a product or service to their following is commonly referred to as Influencer Marketing.
SM,social media,EXT,"The Cambridge Dictionary defines an ""influencer"" as any person  who has the ability to affect the opinions, behaviors, or purchases of others through the use of SM."
SM,social media,EXT,"On SM, consumers are exposed to the purchasing practices of peers through messages from a peer's account, which may be peer-written."
SM,social media,EXT,"A 2011 study focusing on peer communication through SM described how communication between peers through SM can affect purchase intentions: a direct impact through conformity, and an indirect impact by stressing product engagement."
SM,social media,EXT,The study indicated that SM communication between peers about a product had a positive relationship with product engagement.
SM,social media,EXT,"Signals from SM are used to assess academic publications, as well as for different scientific approaches."
SM,social media,EXT,Another study found that most of the health science students acquiring academic materials from others through SM.
SM,social media,EXT,"According to CNN, in 2010 75% of people got their news forwarded through e-mail or SM posts, whereas 37% of people shared a news item via Facebook or Twitter."
SM,social media,EXT,"From a 2019 poll, Pew Research Center found that Americans are wary about the ways that SM sites share news and certain content."
SM,social media,EXT,This wariness of accuracy is on the rise as SM sites are increasingly exploited by aggregated new sources which stitch together multiple feeds to develop plausible correlations.
SM,social media,EXT,News media coverage of the incident was minimal until SM users made the story recognizable through their constant discussion of the case.
SM,social media,EXT,"As a social tool ===

Social media are used to fulfill perceived social needs, but not all needs can be fulfilled by SM."
SM,social media,EXT,A nationally representative survey from Common Sense Media in 2018 found that 40% of American teens ages 13-17 thought that SM was “extremely” or “very” important for them to keep up with their friends on a day-to-basis.
SM,social media,EXT,"The same survey found that 33% of teens said SM was extremely or very important to have meaningful conversations with close friends, and 23% of teens said SM was extremely or very important to document and share highlights from their lives."
SM,social media,EXT,"Recently, a Gallup poll from May 2020 showed that 53% of adult SM users in the United States thought that SM was a very or moderately important way to keep in touch with those they cannot otherwise see in-person due to social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic."
SM,social media,EXT,Sherry Turkle explores this topic in her book Alone Together as she discusses how people confuse SM usage with authentic communication.
SM,social media,EXT,"Additionally, Some online behaviors can cause stress and anxiety, due to the permanence of online posts, the fear of being hacked, or of universities and employers exploring SM pages."
SM,social media,EXT,"However, that same study showed that passively using SM without sending or receiving messages does not make people feel less lonely unless they were lonely to begin with."
SM,social media,EXT,"The term SM ""stalking"" or ""creeping"" have been popularized over the years, and this refers to looking at the person's ""timeline, status updates, tweets, and online bios"" to find information about them and their activities."
SM,social media,EXT,"While SM creeping is common, it is considered to be poor form to admit to a new acquaintance or new date that you have looked through his or her SM posts, particularly older posts, as this will indicate that you were going through their old history."
SM,social media,EXT,"A sub-category of creeping is creeping ex-partners' SM posts after a breakup to investigate if there is a new partner or new dating; this can lead to preoccupation with the ex, rumination, and negative feelings, all of which postpone recovery and increase feelings of loss."
SM,social media,EXT,Catfishing has become more prevalent since the advent of SM.
SM,social media,EXT,"For example, in a 2016 peer-reviewed article by Trudy Hui Hui Chua and Leanne Chang, the authors found that teenage girls manipulate their self-presentation on SM to achieve a sense of beauty that is projected by their peers."
SM,social media,EXT,These authors also discovered that teenage girls compare themselves to their peers on SM and present themselves in certain ways in an effort to earn regard and acceptance.
SM,social media,EXT,"Literature suggests that SM can breed a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos, self-comparison, feelings of disappointment when perceived social success is not achieved, and disordered body perception."
SM,social media,EXT,"===
Social media can also function as a supportive system for adolescents' health, because by using SM, adolescents are able to mobilize around health issues that they themselves deem relevant."
SM,social media,EXT,"For example, in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoing treatment for obesity, the participants' expressed that through SM, they could find personalized weight-loss content as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity"
SM,social media,EXT,"Other SM, such as pro-anorexia sites, have been found in studies to cause significant risk of harm by reinforcing negative health-related behaviors through social networking, especially in adolescents."
SM,social media,EXT,One phenomenon that is commonly studied with SM is the issue of social comparison.
SM,social media,EXT,One study in 2017 found that problematic SM use  was related to lower life satisfaction and self-esteem scores; the authors speculate that users may feel if their life is not exciting enough to put online
SM,social media,EXT,Studies have shown that self-comparison on SM can have dire effects on physical and mental health because they give us the ability to seek approval and compare ourselves.
SM,social media,EXT,"In one study, women reported that SM are the most influential sources of their body image satisfaction; while men reported them as the second most impacting factor."
SM,social media,EXT,"According to a study released in 2017 by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, the link between sleep disturbance and the use of SM was clear."
SM,social media,EXT,"It concluded that blue light had a part to play—and how often they logged on, rather than time spent on SM sites, was a higher predictor of disturbed sleep, suggesting ""an obsessive 'checking'""."
SM,social media,EXT,The strong relationship of SM use and sleep disturbance has significant clinical ramifications for young adults health and well-being.
SM,social media,EXT,"In a recent study, we have learned that people in the highest quartile for SM use per week report the most sleep disturbance."
SM,social media,EXT,The median number of minutes of SM use per day is 61 minutes.
SM,social media,EXT,"One studied emotional effect is ""Facebook depression"", which is a type of depression that affects adolescents who spend too much of their free time engaging with SM sites."
SM,social media,EXT,"A 2017 study of almost 6,000 adolescent students showed that those who self-reported addiction-like symptoms of SM use were more likely to report low self-esteem and high levels of depressive symptoms."
SM,social media,EXT,"In a different study conducted in 2007, those who used the most multiple SM platforms  had more than three times the risk of depression and anxiety than people who used the fewest .A second emotional effect is SM burnout, which is defined by Bo Han as ambivalence, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization."
SM,social media,EXT,Ambivalence refers to a user's confusion about the benefits she can get from using a SM site.
SM,social media,EXT,Emotional exhaustion refers to the stress a user has when using a SM site.
SM,social media,EXT,Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a SM site a user experiences.
SM,social media,EXT,The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's SM continuance.
SM,social media,EXT,"This study provides an instrument to measure the burnout a user can experience when his or her SM ""friends"" are generating an overwhelming amount of useless information ."
SM,social media,EXT,It is associated with checking updates on friends' activities on SM.
SM,social media,EXT,Some speculate that checking updates on friends' activities on SM may be associated with negative influences on people's psychological health and well-being because it could contribute to negative mood and depressed feelings.
SM,social media,EXT,"While SM has differences among age groups, a 2010 study in the United States found no racial divide."
SM,social media,EXT,"A 2015 study found that 65% of Nigerians, 61% of Indonesians, and 58% of Indians agree with the statement that ""Facebook is the Internet"" compared with only 5% in the US.Eric Ehrmann contends that SM in the form of public diplomacy create a patina of inclusiveness that covers traditional economic interests that are structured to ensure that wealth is pumped up to the top of the economic pyramid, perpetuating the digital divide and post-Marxian class conflict."
SM,social media,EXT,He also voices concern over the trend that finds social utilities operating in a quasi-libertarian global environment of oligopoly that requires users in economically challenged nations to spend high percentages of annual income to pay for devices and services to participate in the SM lifestyle.
SM,social media,EXT,"Neil Postman also contends that SM will increase an information disparity between ""winners"" – who are able to use the SM actively – and ""losers"" – who are not familiar with modern technologies or who do not have access to them."
SM,social media,EXT,"People with high SM skills may have better access to information about job opportunities, potential new friends, and social activities in their area, which may enable them to improve their standard of living and their quality of life."
SM,social media,EXT,"According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans at least occasionally receive news from SM."
SM,social media,EXT,"Because of algorithms on SM which filter and display news content which are likely to match their users’ political preferences, a potential impact of receiving news from SM includes an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure."
SM,social media,EXT,Efforts to combat selective exposure in SM may also cause an increase in political polarization.
SM,social media,EXT,"Though research has shown evidence that SM plays a role in increasing political polarization, it has also shown evidence that SM use leads to a persuasion of political beliefs."
SM,social media,EXT,"An online survey consisting of 1,024 U.S. participants was conducted by Diehl, Weeks, and Gil de Zuñiga, which found that individuals who use SM were more likely to have their political beliefs persuaded than those who did not."
SM,social media,EXT,"In particular, those using SM as a means to receive their news were the most likely to have their political beliefs changed."
SM,social media,EXT,Research has also shown that SM use may not have an effect on polarization at all.
SM,social media,EXT,"A U.S. national survey of 1,032 participants conducted by Lee et al. found that participants who used SM were more likely to be exposed to a diverse number of people and amount of opinion than those who did not, although using SM was not correlated with a change in political polarization for these participants."
SM,social media,EXT,"In a study examining the potential polarizing effects of SM on the political views of its users, Mihailidis and Viotty suggest that a new way of engaging with SM must occur to avoid polarization."
SM,social media,EXT,"The authors note that media literacies  are important to using SM in a responsible and productive way, and state that these literacies must be changed further in order to have the most effectiveness."
SM,social media,EXT,"In order to decrease polarization and encourage cooperation among SM users, Mihailidis and Viotty suggest that media literacies must focus on teaching individuals how to connect with other people in a caring way, embrace differences, and understand the ways in which SM has a real impact on the political, social, and cultural issues of the society they are a part of."
SM,social media,EXT,"Recent research has demonstrated that SM, and media in general, have the power to increase the scope of stereotypes not only in children but people of all ages."
SM,social media,EXT,"Three researchers at Blanquerna University, Spain, examined how adolescents interact with SM and specifically Facebook."
SM,social media,EXT,"The emergence of SM platforms fused together different cultures and their communication methods, blending together various cultural thinking patterns and expression styles."
SM,social media,EXT,"The commonly known ""LOL"" has become globally recognized as the abbreviation for ""laugh out loud"" thanks to SM."
SM,social media,EXT,"With the introduction of SM platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information."
SM,social media,EXT,"Hashtags can be used when people want to advocate for a movement, store content or tweets from a movement for future use, and allow other SM users to contribute to a discussion about a certain movement by using existing hashtags."
SM,social media,EXT,"From Facebook comments to likes on Instagram, how the youth communicate, and what is socially acceptable is now heavily based on SM."
SM,social media,EXT,"On the other hand, SM also benefits the youth and how they communicate."
SM,social media,EXT,"Through the use of SM, kids and young adults are able to strengthen relationships by keeping in touch with friends and family, make more friends, and participate in community engagement activities and services."
SM,social media,EXT,"Criticisms of SM range from criticisms of the ease of use of specific platforms and their capabilities, disparity of information available, issues with trustworthiness and reliability of information presented, the impact of SM use on an individual's concentration, ownership of media content, and the meaning of interactions created by SM."
SM,social media,EXT,"Although some SM platforms, such as servers in the decentralised Fediverse, offer users the opportunity to cross-post between independently run servers using a standard protocol such as ActivityPub, the dominant social network platforms have been criticized for poor interoperability between platforms, which leads to the creation of information silos, viz."
SM,social media,EXT,isolated pockets of data contained in one SM platform.
SM,social media,EXT,"However, it is also argued that SM has positive effects, such as allowing the democratization of the Internet while also allowing individuals to advertise themselves and form friendships."
SM,social media,EXT,There has been a dramatic decrease in face-to-face interactions as more and more SM platforms have been introduced with the threat of cyber-bullying and online sexual predators being more prevalent.
SM,social media,EXT,"Their actions focused on gaining massive numbers of followers, include use of advanced scripts and manipulation techniques that distort the prime idea of SM by abusing human trustfulness."
SM,social media,EXT,"British-American entrepreneur and author Andrew Keen criticizes SM in his book The Cult of the Amateur, writing, ""Out of this anarchy, it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism, the survival of the loudest and most opinionated."
SM,social media,EXT,"Comparative media professor José van Dijck contends in her book The Culture of Connectivity  that to understand the full weight of SM, their technological dimensions should be connected to the social and the cultural."
SM,social media,EXT,She critically describes six SM platforms.
SM,social media,EXT,Essena O'Neill attracted international coverage when she explicitly left SM.
SM,social media,EXT,There has been speculation that SM has become perceived as a trustworthy source of information by a large number of people.
SM,social media,EXT,"The continuous interpersonal connectivity on SM, for example, may lead to people regarding peer recommendations as indicators of the reliability of information sources."
SM,social media,EXT,Some SM has started to employ this.
SM,social media,EXT,"In contrast, in the United States , the social network had 306 million accounts as of 2012.Professor Matthew Auer of Bates College casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that SM are open and participatory."
SM,social media,EXT,"He also speculates on the emergence of ""anti-SM"" used as ""instruments of pure control"".

SM,social media,EXT,"Users tend to click through Terms of Use agreements when signing up on SM platforms, and they do not know how their information will be used by companies."
SM,social media,EXT,Some SM outlets have added capture time and Geotagging that helps provide information about the context of the data as well as making their data more accurate.
SM,social media,EXT,"For Malcolm Gladwell, the role of SM, such as Twitter and Facebook, in revolutions and protests is overstated."
SM,social media,EXT,"On one hand, SM makes it easier for individuals, and in this case activists, to express themselves."
SM,social media,EXT,"Gladwell distinguishes between SM activism and high-risk activism, which brings real changes."
SM,social media,EXT,"Gladwell discusses that SM are built around weak ties and he argues that ""social networks are effective at increasing participation — by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires""."
SM,social media,EXT,"Disputing Gladwell's theory, in the study ""Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis"", Kwak and colleagues conducted a survey which found that people who are politically expressive on SM are also more likely to participate in offline political activity."

SM,social media,EXT,"There are arguments that ""privacy is dead"" and that with SM growing more and more, some heavy SM users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy."
SM,social media,EXT,There is also a disconnect between SM user's words and their actions.
SM,social media,EXT,"Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on SM suggest otherwise."
SM,social media,EXT,Everyone leaves a trail when they use SM.
SM,social media,EXT,"Every time someone creates a new SM account, they provide personal information that can include their name, birthdate, geographic location, and personal interests."
SM,social media,EXT,Another factor is ignorance of how accessible SM posts are.
SM,social media,EXT,"Some SM users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their posts; in fact, on some SM sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience."
SM,social media,EXT,"According to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect SM has on expectations of privacy, ""1.18 billion people will log into their Facebook accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on Instagram"" in a day."
SM,social media,EXT,Sharing has become a phenomenon which SM and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.
SM,social media,EXT,"People desire privacy in some shape or form, yet also contribute to SM, which makes it difficult to maintain privacy."

SM,social media,EXT,"As SM usage has become increasingly widespread, SM has to a large extent come to be subjected to commercialization by marketing companies and advertising agencies."
SM,social media,EXT,"Christofer Laurell, a digital marketing researcher, suggested that the SM landscape currently consists of three types of places because of this development: consumer-dominated places, professionally dominated places and places undergoing commercialization."
SM,social media,EXT,"As SM becomes commercialized, this process have been shown to create novel forms of value networks stretching between consumer and producer in which a combination of personal, private and commercial contents are created."
SM,social media,EXT,"As one of the biggest preoccupations among adolescents is SM usage, researchers have begun using the term ""F.A.D."", or ""Facebook addiction disorder"", a form of internet addiction disorder."

SM,shared memory,EXT,"In computer science, SM is memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple programs with an intent to provide communication among them or avoid redundant copies."
SM,shared memory,EXT,"Using memory for communication inside a single program, e.g. among its multiple threads, is also referred to as SM."
SM,shared memory,EXT,"In hardware ==

In computer hardware, SM refers to a  block of random access memory  that can be accessed by several different central processing units  in a multiprocessor computer system."
SM,shared memory,EXT,A SM system is relatively easy to program since all processors share a single view of data and the communication between processors can be as fast as memory accesses to a same location.
SM,shared memory,EXT,"The issue with SM systems is that many CPUs need fast access to memory and will likely cache memory, which has two complications:"
SM,shared memory,EXT,"The alternatives to SM are distributed memory and distributed SM, each having a similar set of issues."
SM,shared memory,EXT,"In computer software, SM is either

a method of inter-process communication , i.e. a way of exchanging data between programs running at the same time."
SM,shared memory,EXT,"This is most often used for shared libraries and for Execute in place .Since both processes can access the SM area like regular working memory, this is a very fast way of communication (as opposed to other mechanisms of IPC such as named pipes,"
SM,shared memory,EXT,"IPC by SM is used for example to transfer images between the application and the X server on Unix systems, or inside the IStream object returned by CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream in the COM libraries under Windows."
SM,shared memory,EXT,"POSIX provides a standardized API for using SM, POSIX Shared Memory."
SM,shared memory,EXT,Unix System V provides an API for SM as well.
SM,shared memory,EXT,The SM created by shm_open is persistent.
SM,shared memory,EXT,This has a drawback that if the process crashes and fails to clean up SM it will stay until system shutdown.
SM,shared memory,EXT,"POSIX also provides the mmap API for mapping files into memory; a mapping can be shared, allowing the file's contents to be used as SM."
SM,shared memory,EXT,"Linux distributions based on the 2.6 kernel and later offer /dev/shm as SM in the form of a RAM disk, more specifically as a world-writable directory  that is stored in memory."
SM,shared memory,EXT,Some C++ libraries provide a portable and object-oriented access to SM functionality.

SM,state machine,EXT,"A finite-SM  or finite-state automaton , finite automaton, or simply a SM, is a mathematical model of computation."
SM,state machine,EXT,Finite-SMs are of two types—deterministic finite-SMs and non-deterministic finite-SMs.
SM,state machine,EXT,A deterministic finite-SM can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.
SM,state machine,EXT,The behavior of SMs can be observed in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented.
SM,state machine,EXT,The finite-SM has less computational power than some other models of computation such as the Turing machine.
SM,state machine,EXT,An example of a simple mechanism that can be modeled by a SM is a turnstile.
SM,state machine,EXT,"Considered as a SM, the turnstile has two possible states: Locked and Unlocked."
SM,state machine,EXT,"The turnstile SM can be represented by a state-transition table, showing for each possible state, the transitions between them  and the outputs resulting from each input:

The turnstile SM can also be represented by a directed graph called a state diagram ."
SM,state machine,EXT,"In some finite-SM representations, it is also possible to associate actions with a state:"
SM,state machine,EXT,UML SMs ===
SM,state machine,EXT,The Unified Modeling Language has a notation for describing SMs.
SM,state machine,EXT,UML SMs overcome the limitations of traditional finite-SMs while retaining their main benefits.
SM,state machine,EXT,"UML SMs introduce the new concepts of hierarchically nested states and orthogonal regions, while extending the notion of actions."
SM,state machine,EXT,UML SMs have the characteristics of both Mealy machines and Moore machines.

SM,state machine,EXT,"decisionSDL embeds basic data types called ""Abstract Data Types"", an action language, and an execution semantic in order to make the finite-SM executable."
SM,state machine,EXT,"In addition to their use in modeling reactive systems presented here, finite-SMs are significant in many different areas, including electrical engineering, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, biology, mathematics, video game programming, and logic."
SM,state machine,EXT,Finite-SMs are a class of automata studied in automata theory and the theory of computation.
SM,state machine,EXT,"In computer science, finite-SMs are widely used in modeling of application behavior, design of hardware digital systems, software engineering, compilers, network protocols, and the study of computation and languages."
SM,state machine,EXT,"Finite-SMs can be subdivided into acceptors, classifiers, transducers and sequencers."
SM,state machine,EXT,"The SM recognizes two commands: ""command_open"" and ""command_close"", which trigger state changes."
SM,state machine,EXT,"A finite-SM with only one state is called a ""combinatorial FSM""."
SM,state machine,EXT,"This concept is useful in cases where a number of finite-SMs are required to work together, and when it is convenient to consider a purely combinatorial part as a form of FSM to suit the design tools."
SM,state machine,EXT,There are other sets of semantics available to represent SMs.
SM,state machine,EXT,"They combine hierarchical SMs , flow graphs, and truth tables into one language, resulting in a different formalism and set of semantics."
SM,state machine,EXT,"These charts, like Harel's original SMs, support hierarchically nested states, orthogonal regions, state actions, and transition actions."
SM,state machine,EXT,A deterministic finite-SM or deterministic finite-state acceptor is a quintuple
SM,state machine,EXT,"This is useful in definitions of general SMs, but less useful when transforming the machine."
SM,state machine,EXT,"A finite-SM has the same computational power as a Turing machine that is restricted such that its head may only perform ""read"" operations, and always has to move from left to right."
SM,state machine,EXT,"That is, each formal language accepted by a finite-SM is accepted by such a kind of restricted Turing machine, and vice versa."
SM,state machine,EXT,A finite-SM with no output function at all is known as a semiautomaton or transition system.
SM,state machine,EXT,Through state encoding for low power SMs may be optimized to minimize power consumption.

PM,point multiplication,EXT,"A widespread name for this operation is also elliptic curve PM, but this can convey the wrong impression of being a multiplication between two points."
PM,point multiplication,EXT,"Given a curve, E, defined along some equation in a finite field , PM is defined as the repeated addition of a point along that curve."
PM,point multiplication,EXT,The straightforward way of computing a PM is through repeated addition.
PM,point multiplication,EXT,This algorithm requires log2 iterations of point doubling and addition to compute the full PM.
PM,point multiplication,EXT,The Montgomery ladder approach computes the PM in a fixed amount of time.
PM,physical machines,EXT,"Another early example was SNOBOL4 , which was written in the SNOBOL Implementation Language , an assembly language for a virtual machine, which was then targeted to PM by transpiling to their native assembler via a macro assembler."

RPC,remote procedure calls,EXT,"Request–response protocols date to early distributed computing in the late 1960s, theoretical proposals of RPC as the model of network operations date to the 1970s, and practical implementations date to the early 1980s."
RPC,remote procedure calls,EXT,The idea of treating network operations as RPC goes back at least to the 1970s in early ARPANET documents.
RPC,remote procedure calls,EXT,An important difference between RPC and local calls is that remote calls can fail because of unpredictable network problems.

GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"In computer science and operations research, a GA  is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms ."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"In a GA, a population of candidate solutions  to an optimization problem is evolved toward better solutions."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"A typical GA requires:

a genetic representation of the solution domain,
a fitness function to evaluate the solution domain."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"In some problems, it is hard or even impossible to define the fitness expression; in these cases, a simulation may be used to determine the fitness function value of a phenotype , or even interactive GAs are used."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Although crossover and mutation are known as the main genetic operators, it is possible to use other operators such as regrouping, colonization-extinction, or migration in GAs."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,A recombination rate that is too high may lead to premature convergence of the GA.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,A hypothesis that a GA performs adaptation by implicitly and efficiently implementing this heuristic.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"highly fit schemata of low defining length and low order play such an important role in the action of GAs, we have already given them a special name: building blocks."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Just as a child creates magnificent fortresses through the arrangement of simple blocks of wood, so does a GA seek near optimal performance through the juxtaposition of short, low-order, high-performance schemata, or building blocks."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,There are limitations of the use of a GA compared to alternative optimization algorithms:
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,Diversity is important in GAs  because crossing over a homogeneous population does not yield new solutions.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"For specific optimization problems and problem instances, other optimization algorithms may be more efficient than GAs in terms of speed of convergence."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"The suitability of GAs is dependent on the amount of knowledge of the problem; well known problems often have better, more specialized approaches."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,The notion of real-valued GAs has been offered but is really a misnomer because it does not really represent the building block theory that was proposed by John Henry Holland in the 1970s.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,Parallel implementations of GAs come in two flavors.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,Coarse-grained parallel GAs assume a population on each of the computer nodes and migration of individuals among the nodes.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,Fine-grained parallel GAs assume an individual on each processor node which acts with neighboring individuals for selection and reproduction.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Other variants, like GAs for online optimization problems, introduce time-dependence or noise in the fitness function."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,Genetic algorithms with adaptive parameters  is another significant and promising variant of GAs.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,The probabilities of crossover  and mutation  greatly determine the degree of solution accuracy and the convergence speed that GAs can obtain.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Problems which appear to be particularly appropriate for solution by GAs include timetabling and scheduling problems, and many scheduling software packages are based on GAs."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"As a general rule of thumb GAs might be useful in problem domains that have a complex fitness landscape as mixing, i.e., mutation in combination with crossover, is designed to move the population away from local optima that a traditional hill climbing algorithm might get stuck in."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,Mutation alone can provide ergodicity of the overall GA process .
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Examples of problems solved by GAs include: mirrors designed to funnel sunlight to a solar collector, antennae designed to pick up radio signals in space, walking methods for computer figures, optimal design of aerodynamic bodies in complex flowfieldsIn his Algorithm Design Manual, Skiena advises against GAs for any task:

t is quite unnatural to model applications in terms of genetic operators like mutation and crossover on bit strings."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Second, GAs take a very long time on nontrivial problems."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"

I have never encountered any problem where GAs seemed to me the right way to attack it."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Further, I have never seen any computational results reported using GAs that have favorably impressed me."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,Fraser's simulations included all of the essential elements of modern GAs.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,Bremermann's research also included the elements of modern GAs.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"In the late 1980s, General Electric started selling the world's first GA product, a mainframe-based toolkit designed for industrial processes."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"The New York Times technology writer John Markoff wrote about Evolver in 1990, and it remained the only interactive commercial GA until 1995."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,Genetic programming often uses tree-based internal data structures to represent the computer programs for adaptation instead of the list structures typical of GAs.
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Grouping GA  is an evolution of the GA where the focus is shifted from individual items, like in classical GAs, to groups or subset of items."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Like GAs, the PSO method depends on information sharing among population members."
GA,genetic algorithm,EXT,"Memetic algorithm , often called hybrid GA among others, is a population-based method in which solutions are also subject to local improvement phases."

MT,machine translation,EXT,"Current MT software often allows for customization by domain or profession , improving output by limiting the scope of allowable substitutions."
MT,machine translation,EXT,It follows that MT of government and legal documents more readily produces usable output than conversation or less standardised text.
MT,machine translation,EXT,The progress and potential of MT have been much debated through its history.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Since the 1950s, a number of scholars, first and most notably Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, have questioned the possibility of achieving fully automatic MT of high quality."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"The origins of MT can be traced back to the work of Al-Kindi, a 9th-century Arabic cryptographer who developed techniques for systemic language translation, including cryptanalysis, frequency analysis, and probability and statistics, which are used in modern MT."
MT,machine translation,EXT,The idea of MT later appeared in the 17th century.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"The memorandum written by Warren Weaver in 1949 is
perhaps the single most influential publication in the earliest days of MT."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Beginning in the late 1980s, as computational power increased and became less expensive, more interest was shown in statistical models for MT."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Therein lies the challenge in MT: how to program a computer that will ""understand"" a text as a person does, and that will ""create"" a new text in the target language that sounds as if it has been written by a person."
MT,machine translation,EXT,It is often argued that the success of MT requires the problem of natural language understanding to be solved first.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"According to the nature of the intermediary representation, an approach is described as interlingual MT or transfer-based MT."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Given enough data, MT programs often work well enough for a native speaker of one language to get the approximate meaning of what is written by the other native speaker."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"To translate between closely related languages, the technique referred to as rule-based MT may be used."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"The rule-based MT paradigm includes transfer-based MT, interlingual MT and dictionary-based MT paradigms."
MT,machine translation,EXT,Transfer-based MT =
MT,machine translation,EXT,Transfer-based MT is similar to interlingual MT in that it creates a translation from an intermediate representation that simulates the meaning of the original sentence.
MT,machine translation,EXT,Interlingual MT is one instance of rule-based machine-translation approaches.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"However, the only interlingual MT system that has been made operational at the commercial level is the KANT system , which is designed to translate Caterpillar Technical English  into other languages."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Statistical MT tries to generate translations using statistical methods based on bilingual text corpora, such as the Canadian Hansard corpus, the English-French record of the Canadian parliament and EUROPARL, the record of the European Parliament."
MT,machine translation,EXT,The first statistical MT software was CANDIDE from IBM.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"With further development, this may allow statistical MT to operate off of a monolingual text corpus."
MT,machine translation,EXT,Example-based MT  approach was proposed by Makoto Nagao in 1984.
MT,machine translation,EXT,Example-based MT is based on the idea of analogy.
MT,machine translation,EXT,Hybrid MT  leverages the strengths of statistical and rule-based translation methodologies.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"It also provides extensive control over the way in which the content is processed during both pre-translation  and post-translation .More recently, with the advent of Neural MT, a new version of hybrid MT is emerging that combines the benefits of rules, statistical and neural MT."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"A deep learning based approach to MT, neural MT has made rapid progress in recent years, and Google has announced its translation services are now using this technology in preference to its previous statistical methods."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Claude Piron, a long-time translator for the United Nations and the World Health Organization, wrote that MT, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text, which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved:"
MT,machine translation,EXT,Limitations on translation from casual speech present issues in the use of MT in mobile devices.
MT,machine translation,EXT,The term rigid designator is what defines these usages for analysis in statistical MT.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"In NLP, ontologies can be used as a source of knowledge for MT systems."
MT,machine translation,EXT,A MT system initially would not be able to differentiate between the meanings because syntax does not change.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"The ontology generated for the PANGLOSS knowledge-based MT system in 1993 may serve as an example of how an ontology for NLP purposes can be compiled:
A large-scale ontology is necessary to help parsing in the active modules of the MT system."
MT,machine translation,EXT,Both algorithms complemented each other and helped constructing a large-scale ontology for the MT system.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"While no system provides the holy grail of fully automatic high-quality MT of unrestricted text, many fully automated systems produce reasonable output."
MT,machine translation,EXT,The quality of MT is substantially improved if the domain is restricted and controlled.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"The European Commission contributed 3.072 million euros  for the creation of MT@EC, a statistical MT program tailored to the administrative needs of the EU, to replace a previous rule-based MT system."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"In 2005, Google claimed that promising results were obtained using a proprietary statistical MT engine."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"The notable rise of social networking on the web in recent years has created yet another niche for the application of MT software – in utilities such as Facebook, or instant messaging clients such as Skype, GoogleTalk, MSN Messenger, etc."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Despite being labelled as an unworthy competitor to human translation in 1966 by the Automated Language Processing Advisory Committee put together by the United States government, the quality of MT has now been improved to such levels that its application in online collaboration and in the medical field are being investigated."
MT,machine translation,EXT,There are many factors that affect how MT systems are evaluated.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"These factors include the intended use of the translation, the nature of the MT software, and the nature of the translation process."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"For example, statistical MT  typically outperforms example-based MT , but researchers found that when evaluating English to French translation, EBMT performs better."
MT,machine translation,EXT,There are various means for evaluating the output quality of MT systems.
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Automated means of evaluation include BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and LEPOR.Relying exclusively on unedited MT ignores the fact that communication in human language is context-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"The late Claude Piron wrote that MT, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text, which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Both example-based and statistical MT rely on a vast array of real example sentences as a base for translation, and when too many or too few sentences are analyzed accuracy is jeopardized."
MT,machine translation,EXT,Using MT as a teaching tool ==
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Although there have been concerns about MT's accuracy, Dr. Ana Nino of the University of Manchester has researched some of the advantages in utilizing MT in the classroom."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"In the early 2000s, options for MT between spoken and signed languages were severely limited."
MT,machine translation,EXT,"Only works that are original are subject to copyright protection, so some scholars claim that MT results are not entitled to copyright protection because MT does not involve creativity."

CS,computer science,EXT,"According to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying CS is, ""What can be automated?""."
CS,computer science,EXT,The earliest foundations of what would become CS predate the invention of the modern digital computer.
CS,computer science,EXT,"As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of CS broadened to study computation in general."
CS,computer science,EXT,"Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and the university was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline, with Columbia offering one of the first academic-credit courses in CS in 1946."
CS,computer science,EXT,"The world's first CS degree program, the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953."
CS,computer science,EXT,The first CS department in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962.
CS,computer science,EXT,It is the now well-known IBM brand that formed part of the CS revolution during this time.
CS,computer science,EXT,"During the late 1950s, the CS discipline was very much in its developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace."
CS,computer science,EXT,"Although first proposed in 1956, the term ""CS"" appears in a 1959 article in Communications of the ACM,
in which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a Graduate School in Computer Sciences analogous to the creation of Harvard Business School in 1921, justifying the name by arguing that, like management science, the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline."
CS,computer science,EXT,"Despite its name, a significant amount of CS does not involve the study of computers themselves."
CS,computer science,EXT,"""A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—Edsger Dijkstra, states that ""CS is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."
CS,computer science,EXT,""" The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than CS."
CS,computer science,EXT,"Early CS was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Rózsa Péter and Alonzo Church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic, category theory, domain theory, and algebra."
CS,computer science,EXT,"The relationship between Computer Science and Software Engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by disputes over what the term ""Software Engineering"" means, and how CS is defined."
CS,computer science,EXT,"David Parnas, taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of CS is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines."
CS,computer science,EXT,"The academic, political, and funding aspects of CS tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis."
CS,computer science,EXT,A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in CS.
CS,computer science,EXT,"As a discipline, CS spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software."
CS,computer science,EXT,"CSAB, formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the Association for Computing Machinery , and the IEEE Computer Society —identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of CS: theory of computation, algorithms and data structures, programming methodology and languages, and computer elements and architecture."
CS,computer science,EXT,"In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of CS.

CS,compressive sensing,EXT,"The field of CS is related to several topics in signal processing and computational mathematics, such as underdetermined linear-systems, group testing, heavy hitters, sparse coding, multiplexing, sparse sampling, and finite rate of innovation."
CS,compressive sensing,EXT,Imaging techniques having a strong affinity with CS include coded aperture and computational photography.
CS,compressive sensing,EXT,"In scanning mode, CS combined with random scanning of the electron beam has enabled both faster acquisition and less electron dose, which allows for imaging of electron beam sensitive materials."
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,This idea is the basis of CS.
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,"There were theoretical results describing when these algorithms recovered sparse solutions, but the required type and number of measurements were sub-optimal and subsequently greatly improved by CS."
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,"At first glance, CS might seem to violate the sampling theorem, because CS depends on the sparsity of the signal in question and not its highest frequency."
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,Sparse signals with high frequency components can be highly under-sampled using CS compared to classical fixed-rate sampling.
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,"In CS, one adds the constraint of sparsity, allowing only solutions which have a small number of nonzero coefficients."
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,"However, if there is a unique sparse solution to the underdetermined system, then the CS framework allows the recovery of that solution."
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,"Edge-preserving total variation  based CS =====

This is an iterative CT reconstruction algorithm with edge-preserving TV regularization to reconstruct CT images from highly undersampled data obtained at low dose CT through low current levels ."
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,"Moreover, in the Internet, network routing matrices usually satisfy the criterion for using CS."
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,Commercial shortwave-infrared cameras based upon CS are available.
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,"In the field of radio astronomy, CS has been proposed for deconvolving an interferometric image."
CS,compressed sensing,EXT,"In fact, the Högbom CLEAN algorithm that has been in use for the deconvolution of radio images since 1974, is similar to CS's matching pursuit algorithm."
CS,critical section,EXT,This protected section is the CS or critical region.
CS,critical section,EXT,"Typically, the CS accesses a shared resource, such as a data structure, a peripheral device, or a network connection, that would not operate correctly in the context of multiple concurrent accesses."
CS,critical section,EXT,Need for CSs ==
CS,critical section,EXT,"In cases like these, a CS is important."
CS,critical section,EXT,x is protected by a CS.
CS,critical section,EXT,"Once B finishes writing the value, A gets the access to the CS and variable x can be read."
CS,critical section,EXT,"By carefully controlling which variables are modified inside and outside the CS, concurrent access to the shared variable are prevented."
CS,critical section,EXT,A CS is typically used when a multi-threaded program must update multiple related variables without a separate thread making conflicting changes to that data.
CS,critical section,EXT,"In a related situation, a CS may be used to ensure that a shared resource, for example, a printer, can only be accessed by one process at a time."
CS,critical section,EXT,Implementation of CSs =
CS,critical section,EXT,The implementation of CSs vary among different operating systems.
CS,critical section,EXT,"A CS will usually terminate in finite time, and a thread, task, or process will have to wait for a fixed time to enter it ."
CS,critical section,EXT,To ensure exclusive use of CSs some  synchronization mechanism is required at the entry and exit of the program.
CS,critical section,EXT,"As shown in Fig 2, in the case of mutual exclusion  , one thread blocks a CS by using locking techniques when it needs to access the shared resource and other threads"
CS,critical section,EXT,The simplest method to prevent any change of processor control inside the CS is implementing a semaphore.
CS,critical section,EXT,"In uni processor systems, this can be done by disabling interrupts on entry into the CS, avoiding system calls that can cause a context switch while inside the section, and restoring interrupts to their previous state on exit."
CS,critical section,EXT,"Any thread of execution entering any CS anywhere in the system will, with this implementation, prevent any other thread, including an interrupt, from being granted processing time on the CPU—and therefore from entering any other CS or, indeed, any code whatsoever—until the original thread leaves its CS."
CS,critical section,EXT,"To enter a CS, a thread must obtain a semaphore, which it releases on leaving the section."
CS,critical section,EXT,"Other threads are prevented from entering the CS at the same time as the original thread, but are free to gain control of the CPU and execute other code, including other CSs that are protected by different semaphores."
CS,critical section,EXT,Uses of CSs =
CS,critical section,EXT,Kernel-level CSs =
CS,critical section,EXT,"Typically, CSs prevent thread and process migration between processors and the preemption of processes and threads by interrupts and other processes and threads."
CS,critical section,EXT,Nesting allows multiple CSs to be entered and exited at little cost.
CS,critical section,EXT,"If the scheduler interrupts the current process or thread in a CS, the scheduler will either allow the currently executing process or thread to run to completion of the CS, or it will schedule the process or thread for another complete quantum."
CS,critical section,EXT,"The scheduler will not migrate the process or thread to another processor, and it will not schedule another process or thread to run while the current process or thread is in a CS."
CS,critical section,EXT,"Similarly, if an interrupt occurs in a CS, the interrupt information is recorded for future processing, and execution is returned to the process or thread in the CS."
CS,critical section,EXT,"Once the CS is exited, and in some cases the scheduled quantum completed, the pending interrupt will be executed."
CS,critical section,EXT,"Since CSs may execute only on the processor on which they are entered, synchronization is only required within the executing processor."
CS,critical section,EXT,This allows CSs to be entered and exited at almost zero cost.
CS,critical section,EXT,This allows CSs in most cases to be nothing more than a per processor count of CSs entered.
CS,critical section,EXT,Performance enhancements include executing pending interrupts at the exit of all CSs and allowing the scheduler to run at the exit of all CSs.
CS,critical section,EXT,Kernel-level CSs are the base of the software lockout issue.
CS,critical section,EXT,"To prevent this, one method is that the entire data-structure can be kept under CS so that only one operation is handled at a time."
CS,critical section,EXT,"Another method is locking the node in use under CS, so that other operations do not use the same node."
CS,critical section,EXT,"Using CS, thus, ensures that the code provides expected outputs."
CS,critical section,EXT,"Hence, the data of the socket is protected by a CS so that program ‘X’ can use it exclusively."
CS,content store,EXT,"A content  repository or CS is a database of digital content with an associated set of data management, search and access methods allowing application-independent access to the content, rather like a digital library, but with the ability to store and modify content in addition to searching and retrieving."
LOS,length of stay,EXT,"A common statistic associated with LOS is the average LOS , a mean calculated by dividing the sum of inpatient days by the number of patients admissions with the same diagnosis-related group classification."
LOS,length of stay,EXT,A variation in the calculation of ALOS can be to consider only LOS during the period under analysis.
LOS,length of stay,EXT,"While the mean LOS is useful from the point of view of costs, it may be a poor statistic in terms of representing a typical LOS; the median may be preferred."
LOS,length of stay,EXT,It is useful to be able to predict an individual's expected LOS or to model LOS to determine factors that affect it.
LOS,length of stay,EXT,Various analyses have sought to model LOS in different condition contexts.
LOS,length of stay,EXT,"The prospective payment system in U.S. Medicare for reimbursing hospital care promotes shorter LOS by paying the same amount for procedures, regardless of days spent in the hospital."
LOS,length of stay,EXT,"Additionally, LOS in hospital can be linked to additional quality metrics such as patient satisfaction with health professionals, reduction in hospital readmissions, and even mortality."
LOS,length of stay,EXT,Discharge planning processes can be effective in reducing a patients LOS in hospital.
LOS,length of stay,EXT,"For example, for older people admitted with a medical condition, discharge planning has been shown to   improve satisfaction, reduce the overall LOS, and within 3 month period reduce the likelihood of readmission.


="
LOS,length of stay,EXT,"The term ""average LOS""  is also applicable to other industries, e.g. entertainment, event marketing, trade show and leisure."
RF,random forest,EXT,"The early development of Breiman's notion of RFs was influenced by the work of Amit and
Geman who introduced the idea of searching over a random subset of the
available decisions when splitting a node, in the context of growing a single
tree."
RF,random forest,EXT,The idea of random subspace selection from Ho was also influential in the design of RFs.
RF,random forest,EXT,"The introduction of RFs proper was first made in a paper
by Leo Breiman."
RF,random forest,EXT,"In addition, this paper combines several
ingredients, some previously known and some novel, which form the basis of the
modern practice of RFs, in particular:

Using out-of-bag error as an estimate of the generalization error."
RF,random forest,EXT,"The report also offers the first theoretical result for RFs in the
form of a bound on the generalization error which depends on the strength of the
trees in the forest and their correlation."
RF,random forest,EXT,"The training algorithm for RFs applies the general technique of bootstrap aggregating, or bagging, to tree learners."
RF,random forest,EXT,"From bagging to RFs ===

The above procedure describes the original bagging algorithm for trees."
RF,random forest,EXT,"While similar to ordinary RFs in that they are an ensemble of individual trees, there are two main differences:"
RF,random forest,EXT,"Similar to ordinary RFs, the number of randomly selected features to be considered at each node can be specified."
RF,random forest,EXT,"n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}_{n}=\{\}_{i=1}^{n}}
   is to fit a RF to the data."
RF,random forest,EXT,"For data including categorical variables with different number of levels, RFs are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels."
RF,random forest,EXT,A relationship between RFs and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm  was pointed out by Lin and Jeon in 2002.
RF,random forest,EXT,Lin and Jeon show that the shape of the neighborhood used by a RF adapts to the local importance of each feature.
RF,random forest,EXT,Unsupervised learning with RFs =
RF,random forest,EXT,"As part of their construction, RF predictors naturally lead to a dissimilarity measure among the observations."
RF,random forest,EXT,One can also define a RF dissimilarity measure between unlabeled data: the idea is to construct a RF predictor that distinguishes the “observed” data from suitably generated synthetic data.
RF,random forest,EXT,"A RF dissimilarity can be attractive because it handles mixed variable types very well, is invariant to monotonic transformations of the input variables, and is robust to outlying observations."
RF,random forest,EXT,"The RF dissimilarity easily deals with a large number of semi-continuous variables due to its intrinsic variable selection; for example, the ""Addcl 1"" RF dissimilarity weighs the contribution of each variable according to how dependent it is on other variables."
RF,random forest,EXT,"The RF dissimilarity has been used in a variety of applications, e.g. to find clusters of patients based on tissue marker data."
RF,random forest,EXT,"Instead of decision trees, linear models have been proposed and evaluated as base estimators in RFs, in particular multinomial logistic regression and naive Bayes classifiers."
RF,random forest,EXT,Kernel RF ==
RF,random forest,EXT,"In machine learning, kernel RFs establish the connection between RFs and kernel methods."
RF,random forest,EXT,"By slightly modifying their definition, RFs can be rewritten as kernel methods, which are more interpretable and easier to analyze."
RF,random forest,EXT,Leo Breiman was the first person to notice the link between RF and kernel methods.
RF,random forest,EXT,He pointed out that RFs which are grown using i.i.d. random vectors in the tree construction are equivalent to a kernel acting on the true margin.
RF,random forest,EXT,"Lin and Jeon established the connection between RFs and adaptive nearest neighbor, implying that RFs can be seen as adaptive kernel estimates."
RF,random forest,EXT,Scornet first defined KeRF estimates and gave the explicit link between KeRF estimates and RF.
RF,random forest,EXT,"He also gave explicit expressions for kernels based on centered RF and uniform RF, two simplified models of RF."
RF,random forest,EXT,"Centered forest is a simplified model for Breiman's original RF, which uniformly selects an attribute among all attributes and performs splits at the center of the cell along the pre-chosen attribute."
RF,random forest,EXT,"Uniform forest is another simplified model for Breiman's original RF, which uniformly selects a feature among all features and performs splits at a point uniformly drawn on the side of the cell, along the preselected feature."
RF,random forest,EXT,From RF to KeRF
RF,random forest,EXT,"Thus RF estimates satisfy, for all"
RF,random forest,EXT,"In order to improve the RF methods and compensate the misestimation, Scornet defined KeRF by

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                m"
RF,random forest,EXT,Relation between KeRF and RF
RF,random forest,EXT,"Predictions given by KeRF and RFs are close if the number of points in each cell is controlled:

Assume that there exist sequences 
  
    
      
        ("
RF,random forest,EXT,Relation between infinite KeRF and infinite RF
RF,random forest,EXT,"When the number of trees 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
   goes to infinity, then we have infinite RF and infinite KeRF."
RF,radio frequency,EXT,The MOS integrated circuit is the technology behind the current proliferation of RF wireless telecommunications devices such as cellphones.
RF,regression forest,EXT,"A random RF is an ensemble of 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
   randomized regression trees."
RF,regression forest,EXT,"Random RF has two level of averaging, first over the samples in the target cell of a tree, then over all trees."
RF,register file,EXT,A RF is an array of processor registers in a central processing unit .
RF,register file,EXT,Modern integrated circuit-based RFs are usually implemented by way of fast static RAMs with multiple ports.
RF,register file,EXT,"In simpler CPUs, these architectural registers correspond one-for-one to the entries in a physical RF  within the CPU."
RF,register file,EXT,"The RF is part of the architecture and visible to the programmer, as opposed to the concept of transparent caches."
RF,register file,EXT,"x86 processors use context switching and fast interrupt for switching between instruction, decoder, GPRs and RFs, if there is more than one, before the instruction is issued, but this is only existing on processors that support superscalar."
RF,register file,EXT,Larger RFs are then sometimes constructed by tiling mirrored and rotated simple arrays.
RF,register file,EXT,"At some point, it may be smaller and/or faster to have multiple redundant RFs, with smaller numbers of read ports, rather than a single RF with all the read ports."
RF,register file,EXT,"The MIPS R8000's integer unit, for example, had a 9 read 4 write port 32 entry 64-bit RF implemented in a 0.7 µm process, which could be seen when looking at the chip from arm's length."
RF,register file,EXT,Two popular approaches to dividing registers into multiple RFs are the distributed RF configuration and the partitioned RF configuration.
RF,register file,EXT,"In principle, any operation that could be done with a 64-bit-wide RF with many read and write ports could be done with a single 8-bit-wide RF with a single read port and a single write port."
RF,register file,EXT,"However, the bit-level parallelism of wide RFs with many ports allows them to run much faster and thus, they can do operations in a single cycle that would take many cycles with fewer ports or a narrower bit width or both."
RF,register file,EXT,The width in bits of the RF is usually the number of bits in the processor word size.
RF,register file,EXT,"If the width of the data word is different than the width of an address—or in some cases, such as the 68000, even when they are the same width—the address registers are in a separate RF than the data registers.


=== Decoder ==="
RF,register file,EXT,"Techniques that reduce the energy used by RFs are useful in low-power electronics


=="
RF,register file,EXT,Most RFs make no special provision to prevent multiple write ports from writing the same entry simultaneously.
RF,register file,EXT,The RF is usually pitch-matched to the datapath that it serves.
RF,register file,EXT,"This case usually forces multiple copies of a RF, one for each datapath."
RF,register file,EXT,"It had two copies of the integer RF and two copies of floating point register that locate in its front end , and took an extra cycle to propagate data between the two during context switch."
RF,register file,EXT,"The MIPS uses multiple RFs as well; the R8000 floating-point unit had two copies of the floating-point RF, each with four write and four read ports, and wrote both copies at the same time with context switch."
RF,register file,EXT,However it did not support integer operations and the integer RF still remained as one.
RF,register file,EXT,"Later, shadow RFs were abandoned in newer designs in favor of embedded market."
RF,register file,EXT,It had up to 4 copies of integer RFs  and 2 copies of the floating point RF.
RF,register file,EXT,"However, unlike Alpha and x86, they are located in backend as retire unit right after its Out of Order Unit and renaming RFs and do not load instruction during instruction fetch and decoding stage and context switch is needless in this design."
RF,register file,EXT,"IBM uses the same mechanism as many major microprocessors, deeply merging the RF with the decoder but its RF"
RF,register file,EXT,most of its RF not just serve for its dedicate decoder only but up to the thread level.
RF,register file,EXT,"For example, POWER8 has up to 8 instruction decoders, but up to 32 RFs of 32 general purpose registers each , to facilitate simultaneous multithreading, which its instruction cannot be used cross any other RF ."
RF,register file,EXT,"In the x86 processor line, a typical pre-486 CPU did not have an individual RF, as all general purpose register were directly work with its decoder, and the x87 push stack was located within the floating-point unit itself."
RF,register file,EXT,"Starting with Pentium, a typical Pentium-compatible x86 processor is integrated with one copy of the single-port architectural RF containing 8 architectural registers, 8 control registers, 8 debug registers, 8 condition code registers, 8 unnamed based register, one instruction pointer, one flag register and 6 segment registers in one file."
RF,register file,EXT,"Beginning with P6, all RFs do not require additional cycle to propagate the data, RFs like architectural and floating point are located between code buffer and decoders, called ""retire buffer"", Reorder buffer and OoOE and connected within the ring bus ."
RF,register file,EXT,The RF itself still remains one x86 RF and one x87 stack and both serve as retirement storing.
RF,register file,EXT,Its x86 RF increased to dual ported to increase bandwidth for result storage.
RF,register file,EXT,Registers like debug/condition code/control/unnamed/flag were stripped from the main RF and placed into individual files between the micro-op ROM and instruction sequencer.
RF,register file,EXT,"Only inaccessible registers like the segment register are now separated from the general-purpose RF ; they are now located between the scheduler and instruction allocator, in order to facilitate register renaming and out-of-order execution."
RF,register file,EXT,"The x87 stack was later merged with the floating-point RF after a 128-bit XMM register debuted in Pentium III, but the XMM RF is still located separately from x86 integer RFs."
RF,register file,EXT,"Later P6 implementations  introduced ""Shadow Register File Architecture"" that expanded to 2 copies of dual ported integer architectural RF and consist with context switch ."
RF,register file,EXT,"The second file is served as a scaled shadow RF, which without context switch the scaled file cannot store some instruction independently."
RF,register file,EXT,"Some instruction from SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 require this feature for integer operation, for example instruction like PSHUFB, PMADDUBSW, PHSUBW, PHSUBD, PHSUBSW, PHADDW, PHADDD, PHADDSW would require loading EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX from both of RF, though it was uncommon for x86 processor to take use of another RF with same instruction; most of time the second file is served as a scale retirered file."
RF,register file,EXT,The Pentium M architecture still remains one dual-ported FP RF  shared with three decoder and FP register
RF,register file,EXT,does not have shadow RF with it as its Shadow Register File Architecture did not including floating point function.
RF,register file,EXT,"Processor after P6, the architectural RF are external and locate in processor's backend after retired, opposite to internal RF that are locate in inner core for register renaming/reorder buffer."
RF,register file,EXT,"Core 2 increased the inner ring bus to 24 bytes  and extended its RF from dual ported  to quad ported , register still remain 8 entries in 32 bit and 32 bytes  in total file size and expanded to 16 entries in x64 for total 128 bytes size per file."
RF,register file,EXT,"Its FP XMM RF are also increase to quad ported , register still remain 8 entries in 32 bit and extended to 16 entries in x64 mode and number still remain 1 as its shadow RF architecture is not including floating point/SSE functions."
RF,register file,EXT,"In later x86 implementations, like Nehalem and later processors, both integer and floating point registers are now incorporated into a unified octa-ported  general-purpose RF , while the RF extended to 2 with enhanced ""Shadow Register File Architecture"" in favorite of executing hyper threading and each thread uses independent RFs for its decoder."
RF,register file,EXT,Later Sandy bridge and onward replaced shadow register table and architectural registers with much large and yet more advance physical RF before decoding to the reorder buffer.
RF,register file,EXT,It includes single copies of RF share with thread and decoder.
RF,register file,EXT,"The RF is a dual-port design, 8/16 entries GPRS, 8/16 entries debug register and"
RF,register file,EXT,"However it has an eight-entries 64 bit shadow based register and an eight-entries 64 bit unnamed register that are now separated from main GPRs unlike the original P5 design and located after the execution unit, and the file of these registers is single-ported and not expose to instruction like scaled shadow RF found on Core/"
RF,register file,EXT,It also had one copy of XMM floating point RF per thread.
RF,register file,EXT,The difference from Nehalem is Bonnell do not have a unified RF and has no dedicated RF for its hyper threading.
RF,register file,EXT,"Similar to Bonnell, Larrabee and Xeon Phi also each have only one general-purpose integer RF, but the Larrabee has up to 16 XMM RFs , and the Xeon Phi has up to 128"
RF,register file,EXT,"RFs, each containing 32 512-bit ZMM registers for vector instruction storage, which can be as big as L2 cache."
RF,register file,EXT,"There are some other of Intel's x86 lines that don't have a RF in their internal design, Geode GX and Vortex86 and many embedded processors that aren't Pentium-compatible or reverse-engineered early 80x86 processors."
RF,register file,EXT,"Therefore, most of them don't have a RF for their decoders, but their GPRs are used individually."
RF,register file,EXT,"Pentium 4, on the other hand, does not have a RF for its decoder, as its x86 GPRs didn't exist within its structure, due to the introduction of a physical unified renaming RF  for attempting to replace the architectural RF and skip the x86 decoding scheme."
RF,register file,EXT,"AMD's early design like K6 do not have a RF like Intel and do not support ""Shadow Register File Architecture"" as its lack of context switch and bypass inverter that are necessary"
RF,register file,EXT,require for a RF to function appropriately.
RF,register file,EXT,"For example, the K6 processor has four int (one eight-entries temporary scratched RF + one eight-entries future RF +"
RF,register file,EXT,"one eight-entries fetched RF + an eight-entries unnamed RF) and two FP rename RFs  that directly link with its x86 EAX for integer renaming and XMM0 register for floating point renaming, but later Athlon included ""shadow register"" in its front end, it's scaled up to 40 entries unified RF for in order integer operation before decoded, the RF contain 8 entries scratch register +"
RF,register file,EXT,16 future GPRs RF + 16 unnamed GPRs RF.
RF,register file,EXT,"Like Phenom, it has three int RFs and two SSE RFs that are located in the physical RF directly linked with GPRs."
RF,register file,EXT,"Unlike Alpha, Sparc, and MIPS that only allows one RF to load/fetch one operand at the time; it would require multiple RFs to achieve superscale."
RF,register file,EXT,The ARM processor on the other hand does not integrate multiple RFs to load/fetch instructions.
RF,register file,EXT,The major difference between ARM and other designs is that ARM allows to run on the same general-purpose register with quick bank switching without requiring additional RF in superscalar.
RF,register file,EXT,"Despite x86 sharing the same mechanism with ARM that its GPRs can store any data individually, x86 will confront data dependency if more than three non-related instructions are stored, as its GPRs per file are too small  for data, and it is impossible to have superscalar without multiple RFs to feed to its decoder ."
RF,register file,EXT,Some third-party x86 equivalent processors even became noncompetitive with ARM due to having no dedicated RF architecture.
RF,register file,EXT,Processors that perform register renaming can arrange for each functional unit to write to a subset of the physical RF.
RF,register file,EXT,"The resulting RF, effectively a stack of RFs with single write ports, then benefits from replication and subsetting the read ports."
RF,register file,EXT,"The SPARC ISA defines register windows, in which the 5-bit architectural names of the registers actually point into a window on a much larger RF, with hundreds of entries."
RF,register file,EXT,Implementing multiported RFs with hundreds of entries requires a large area.
RF,register file,EXT,"To save area, some SPARC implementations implement a 32-entry RF, in which each cell has seven ""bits""."
HS,hierarchical softmax,EXT,A Word2vec model can be trained with HS and/or negative sampling.
HS,hierarchical softmax,EXT,"To approximate the conditional log-likelihood a model seeks to maximize, the HS method uses a Huffman tree to reduce calculation."
HS,hierarchical softmax,EXT,"According to the authors, HS works better for infrequent words while negative sampling works better for frequent words and better with low dimensional vectors."
HS,hierarchical softmax,EXT,"As training epochs increase, HS stops being useful.

DR,demand response,EXT,"According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, DR  is defined as:"
DR,demand response,EXT,"It is expected that DR programs will be designed to decrease electricity consumption or shift it from on-peak to off-peak periods depending on consumers’ 
preferences and lifestyles."
DR,demand response,EXT,"Hence, DR can be a more cost-effective alternative than adding generation capabilities to meet the peak and occasional demand spikes."
DR,demand response,EXT,"The difference is that DR mechanisms respond to explicit requests to shut off, whereas dynamic demand devices passively shut off when stress in the grid is sensed."
DR,demand response,EXT,"At the same time, DR is a component of smart energy demand, which also includes energy efficiency, home and building energy management, distributed renewable resources, and electric vehicle charging."
DR,demand response,EXT,"Current DR schemes are implemented with large and small commercial as well as residential customers, often through the use of dedicated control systems to shed loads in response to a request by a utility or market price conditions."
DR,demand response,EXT,"Under conditions of tight electricity supply, DR can significantly decrease the peak price and, in general, electricity price volatility."
DR,demand response,EXT,"Depending on the configuration of generation capacity, however, DR may also be used to increase demand  at times of high production and low demand."
DR,demand response,EXT,"There are three types of DR - emergency DR, economic DR and ancillary services DR."
DR,demand response,EXT,Emergency DR is employed to avoid involuntary service interruptions during times of supply scarcity.
DR,demand response,EXT,Economic DR is employed to allow electricity customers to curtail their consumption when the productivity or convenience of consuming that electricity is worth less to them than paying for the electricity.
DR,demand response,EXT,Ancillary services DR consists of a number of specialty services that are needed to ensure the secure operation of the transmission grid and which have traditionally been provided by generators.
DR,demand response,EXT,"This emerging technology will allow customers to shift from an event-based DR where the utility requests the shedding of load, towards a more 24/7-based DR where the customer sees incentives for controlling load all the time."
DR,demand response,EXT,"Although this back-and-forth dialogue increases the opportunities for DR, customers are still largely influenced by economic incentives and are reluctant to relinquish total control of their assets to utility companies."
DR,demand response,EXT,"Smart grid applications increase the opportunities for DR by providing real time data to producers and consumers, but the economic and environmental incentives remain the driving force behind the practice."
DR,demand response,EXT,One of the most important means of DR in the future smart grids is electric vehicles.

DR,demand response,EXT,This is the basis of DR.
DR,demand response,EXT,"In order to implement DR systems, coordination of large numbers of distributed resources through sensors, actuators, and communications protocols becomes necessary."
DR,demand response,EXT,"Many independent system operators are structuring the rules of ancillary service markets such that DR can participate alongside traditional supply-side resources - the available capacity of the generators can be used more efficiently when operated as designed, resulting in lower costs and less pollution."
DR,demand response,EXT,"Technologies are available, and more are under development, to automate the process of DR."
DR,demand response,EXT,Other methods to implementing DR approach the issue of subtly reducing duty cycles rather than implementing thermostat setbacks.
DR,demand response,EXT,Industrial customers are also providing DR.
DR,demand response,EXT,"Compared with commercial and residential loads, industrial loads have the following advantages: the magnitude of power consumption by an industrial manufacturing plant and the change in power it can provide are generally very large; besides, the industrial plants usually already have the infrastructures for control, communication and market participation, which enables the provision of DR; moreover, some industrial plants such as the aluminum smelter are able to offer fast and accurate adjustments in their power consumption."
DR,demand response,EXT,"For example, Alcoa's Warrick Operation is participating in MISO as a qualified DR resource, and the Trimet Aluminium uses its smelter as a short-term nega-battery."
DR,demand response,EXT,The selection of suitable industries for DR provision is typically based on an assessment of the so-called value of lost load.
DR,demand response,EXT,"Some data centers are located far apart for redundancy and can migrate loads between them, while also performing DR."

MP,max pooling,EXT,introduced the concept of MP.
MP,max pooling,EXT,They did so by combining TDNNs with MP in order to realize a speaker independent isolated word recognition system.
MP,max pooling,EXT,The results of each TDNN over the input signal were combined using MP and the outputs of the pooling layers were then passed on to networks performing the actual word classification.
MP,max pooling,EXT,There are several non-linear functions to implement pooling among which MP is the most common.
MP,max pooling,EXT,"In addition to MP, pooling units can use other functions, such as average pooling or ℓ2-norm pooling."
MP,max pooling,EXT,"Average pooling was often used historically but has recently fallen out of favor compared to MP, which performs better in practice."
MP,max pooling,EXT,"""Region of Interest"" pooling  is a variant of MP, in which output size is fixed and input rectangle is a parameter."
MP,max pooling,EXT,"Finally, after several convolutional and MP layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connected layers."
MP,max pooling,EXT,"An alternate view of stochastic pooling is that it is equivalent to standard MP but with many copies of an input image, each having small local deformations."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"In computing, a VM  is an emulation of a computer system."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"There are different kinds of VMs, each with different functions:"
VM,virtual machine,EXT,System VMs  provide a substitute for a real machine.
VM,virtual machine,EXT,Process VMs are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"Some VMs, such as QEMU, are designed to also emulate different architectures and allow execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"=== System VMs ===

A ""VM"" was originally defined by Popek and Goldberg as ""an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real computer machine."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,Current use includes VMs that have no direct correspondence to any real hardware.
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"The physical, ""real-world"" hardware running the VM is generally referred to as the 'host', and the VM emulated on that machine is generally referred to as the 'guest'."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"The desire to run multiple operating systems was the initial motive for VMs, so as to allow time-sharing among several single-tasking operating systems."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"In some respects, a system VM can be considered a generalization of the concept of virtual memory that historically preceded it."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"Unlike virtual memory, a system VM entitled the user to write privileged instructions in their code."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"As technology evolves virtual memory for purposes of virtualization, new systems of memory overcommitment may be applied to manage memory sharing among multiple VMs on one computer operating system."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"It may be possible to share memory pages that have identical contents among multiple VMs that run on the same physical machine, what may result in mapping them to the same physical page by a technique termed kernel same-page merging ."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"This is especially useful for read-only pages, such as those holding code segments, which is the case for multiple VMs running the same or similar software, software libraries, web servers, middleware components, etc."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,The use of VMs to support separate guest operating systems is popular in regard to embedded systems.
VM,virtual machine,EXT,Process VMs =
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"A process VM, sometimes called an application VM, or Managed Runtime Environment , runs as a normal application inside a host OS and supports a single process."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"This type of VM has become popular with the Java programming language, which is implemented using the Java VM."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"Other examples include the Parrot VM and the .NET Framework, which runs on a VM called the Common Language Runtime."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,They are not strictly VMs because the applications running on top still have access to all OS services and are therefore not confined to the system model.
VM,virtual machine,EXT,Both system VMs and process VMs date to the 1960s and continue to be areas of active development.
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"System VMs grew out of time-sharing, as notably implemented in the Compatible Time-Sharing System ."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"This evolved into VMs, notably via IBM's research systems: the M44/44X, which used partial virtualization, and the CP-40 and SIMMON, which used full virtualization, and were early examples of hypervisors."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,The first widely available VM architecture was the CP-67/CMS .
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"An important distinction was between using multiple VMs on one host system for time-sharing, as in M44/44X and CP-40, and using one VM on a host system for prototyping, as in SIMMON."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,Process VMs arose originally as abstract platforms for an intermediate language used as the intermediate representation of a program by a compiler; early examples date to around 1966.
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"An early 1966 example was the O-code machine, a VM that executes O-code  emitted by the front end of the BCPL compiler."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"This has been influential, and VMs in this sense have been often generally called p-code machines."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"In addition to being an intermediate language, Pascal p-code was also executed directly by an interpreter implementing the VM, notably in UCSD Pascal ; this influenced later interpreters, notably the Java VM ."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"Another early example was SNOBOL4 , which was written in the SNOBOL Implementation Language , an assembly language for a VM, which was then targeted to physical machines by transpiling to their native assembler via a macro assembler."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"Process VMs were a popular approach to implementing early microcomputer software, including Tiny BASIC and adventure games, from one-off implementations such as Pyramid 2000 to a general-purpose engine like Infocom's z-machine, which Graham Nelson argues is ""possibly the most portable VM ever created""."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"Significant advances occurred in the implementation of Smalltalk-80,
particularly the Deutsch/Schiffmann implementation
which pushed just-in-time  compilation forward as an implementation approach that uses process VM."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"A related language that produced a lot of VM innovation was the Self programming language, which pioneered adaptive optimization and generational garbage collection."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,These techniques proved commercially successful in 1999 in the HotSpot Java VM.
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"Other innovations include having a register-based VM, to better match the underlying hardware, rather than a stack-based VM, which is a closer match for the programming language; in 1995, this was pioneered by the Dis VM for the Limbo language."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"In full virtualization, the VM simulates enough hardware to allow an unmodified ""guest"" OS  to be run in isolation."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"In hardware-assisted virtualization, the hardware provides architectural support that facilitates building a VM monitor and allows guest OSes to be run in isolation."
VM,virtual machine,EXT,"Hardware-assisted virtualization was first introduced on the IBM System/370 in 1972, for use with VM/370, the first VM operating system offered by IBM as an official product."

FC,fusion center,EXT,"The actions of individual FCs have also been criticized for actions such as labeling universities as terrorism threats, targeting third party candidates and supporters as potential militia members, and incorrectly blaming a faulty water pump on Russian hackers."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"A FC is a collaborative effort between law enforcement agencies to share resources, expertise, and information in order to detect criminal and terrorist activity."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"A FC is typically organized by combining representatives from different federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies into one physical location."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"Some FCs gather information not only from government sources, but also from their partners in the private sector."
FC,fusion center,EXT,State and local police departments provide both space and resources for the majority of FCs.
FC,fusion center,EXT,"A number of FCs operate tip hotlines and also invite relevant information from public employees, such as sanitation workers or firefighters."

FC,fusion center,EXT,History of the FC concept =
FC,fusion center,EXT,"The FC concept was created as a result of the September 11 report, in an attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to create better communication and cooperation between state, local, and territorial law enforcement with federal law enforcement entities including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security and several others."
FC,fusion center,EXT,The United States Congress in its oversight capacity has issued multiple reports on FCs in the United States.
FC,fusion center,EXT,The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a report in 2012 criticising the usefulness of FCs and practices.
FC,fusion center,EXT,"In a review of 13 months of FC reports, the Subcommittee found no examples of a FC uncovering a terrorist threat, and they criticized the use of reporting quotas for leading to a high rate of useless information being reported on by the centers."
FC,fusion center,EXT,An example highlighted in the Senate report was a California FC report on the Mongols Motorcycle Club's distribution of leaflets to its members instructing them how to behave when stopped by police.
FC,fusion center,EXT,"One supervisor eventually killed the FC report, noting that ""There is nothing illegal or even remotely objectionable  in this report,"" and that ""The advice given to the groups' members is protected by the First Amendment."
FC,fusion center,EXT,Senate report argued that the report quality was diminished by the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis imposing a quota on the number of reports that must be filed by the FCs.
FC,fusion center,EXT,The Senate committee estimated that about $1.4 billion had been spent on the FCs.
FC,fusion center,EXT,"Matthew Chandler, a spokesperson for the DHS, immediately denounced the Senate report in an interview with Fox News, in which he said that ""In preparing the report, the committee refused to review relevant data, including important intelligence information pertinent to their findings,"" and that the ""report fundamentally misunderstands the role of the federal government in supporting FCs and overlooks the significant benefits of this relationship to both state and local law enforcement and the federal government."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"""A 2013 report by the House Homeland Security committee reported on visits to 32 of the 78 FCs and 9 committee hearings."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"The Committee found that FCs were an asset, but needed improved federal assistance to reach their full potential."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"The lack of a State-focused, national strategy for FCs was highlighted as a major barrier to the effectiveness of FCs."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"The report notes that FCs do not universally focus on the implications of intelligence for national security, and while FCs should fulfill their State and local missions, they must do so in a way that requires analysis with an eye towards counterterrorism."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"The Committee takes issue with the previous performance metrics which focused on quantity rather than quality of reports, and this inability to assess the quality of reports makes evaluating the value of FCs difficult."
FC,fusion center,EXT,A 2017 report by the House Homeland Security committee reported on interviews with staff from 15 FCs and 68 responses to its survey of the 78 FCs.
FC,fusion center,EXT,The report highlight the growth of FC operations since its previous 2013 report and highlighted particular challenges which threaten to reduce the effectiveness of FCs.
FC,fusion center,EXT,"Respondents to the survey raised concerns about their centers' limited access to unclassified and classified information, and the Committee critiqued the level of technical support offered to FCs in order to handle cyber threats."
FC,fusion center,EXT,The report took issue with the recent decisions of social media companies to restrict access to their data by FCs.
FC,fusion center,EXT,"There are a number of documented criticisms of FCs, including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities, the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism, and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others."
FC,fusion center,EXT,One such FC has been involved with spying on anti-war and peace activists as well as anarchists in Washington state.
FC,fusion center,EXT,"David Rittgers of the Cato Institute has noted:

a long line of FC and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"The North Texas Fusion System labeled Muslim lobbyists as a potential threat; a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro- and anti-abortion activists were worrisome; a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists, Tea Party groups, and a Second Amendment rally; the Maryland State Police put anti-death penalty and anti-war activists in a federal terrorism database; a FC in Missouri thought that all third-party voters and Ron Paul supporters were a threat; and the Department of Homeland Security described half of the American political spectrum as ""right wing extremists."""
FC,fusion center,EXT,"A 2007 ACLU report raised concerns with four areas of FC aspects, the first of which was that they suffered from ""ambiguous lines of authority"", meaning that the fusion process ""allows the authorities to manipulate differences in federal, state and local laws to maximize information collection while evading accountability and oversight through the practice of 'policy shopping'."
FC,fusion center,EXT,""" The ACLU was also concerned with the private sector and military participation in the surveillance of US citizens through these FCs."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"Finally, the ACLU report argued that FCs were likely to engage in poorly contained data mining because the ""Federal FC guidelines encourage wholesale data collection and manipulation processes that threaten privacy"" and that the centers were ""hobbled by excessive secrecy""."
FC,fusion center,EXT,"An updated ACLU report in 2008 argued that the FCs were creating a ""total surveillance society"" in the US."

EL,entity linking,EXT,Challenges in EL ===
EL,entity linking,EXT,An EL system has to deal with a number of challenges before being performant in real-life applications.
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Some of these issues are intrinsic to the task of EL, such as text ambiguity, while others, such as scalability and execution time, become relevant when considering real-life usage of such systems."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"In all these cases, the EL system should return a NIL entity link."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Understanding when to return a NIL prediction is not straightforward, and many different approaches have been proposed; for example, by thresholding some kind of confidence score in the EL system, or by adding an additional NIL entity to the knowledge base, which is treated in the same way as the other entities."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Scalability and Speed: it is desirable for an industrial EL system to provide results in a reasonable time, and often in real-time."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"This requirement is critical for search engines, chat-bots and for EL systems offered by data-analytics platforms."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Evolving Information: an EL system should also deal with evolving information, and easily integrate updates in the knowledge base."
EL,entity linking,EXT,Multiple Languages: an EL systems might support queries performed in multiple languages.
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Ideally, the accuracy of the EL system should not be influenced by the input language, and entities in the knowledge base should be the same across different languages."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Definitions are often blurry and vary slightly among different authors: Alhelbawy et al. consider EL as a broader version of NED, as NED should assume that the entity that correctly match a certain textual named entity mention is in the knowledge base."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Wikification is the task of linking textual mentions to entities in Wikipedia .Record linkage  is considered a broader field than EL, and consists in finding records, across multiple and often heterogeneous data-sets, that refer to the same entity."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Named-entity recognition is usually a preprocessing step of an EL system, as it can be useful to know in advance which words should be linked to entities of the knowledge base."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"A notable distinction compared to EL is that Coreference Resolution does not assign any unique identity to the words it matches, but it simply says whether they refer to the same entity or not.


=="
EL,entity linking,EXT,Approaches to EL ==
EL,entity linking,EXT,"However, as of today most existing challenges are still unsolved, and many EL systems, with widely different strengths and weaknesses, have been proposed."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Broadly speaking, modern EL systems can be divided into two categories:"
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Often EL systems cannot be strictly categorized in either category, but they make use of knowledge graphs that have been enriched with additional textual features extracted, for example, from the text corpora that were used to build the knowledge graphs themselves.


=="
EL,entity linking,EXT,Text-based EL =
EL,entity linking,EXT,"The seminal work by Cucerzan in 2007 proposed one of the first EL systems that appeared in the literature, and tackled the task of wikification, linking textual mentions to Wikipedia pages."
EL,entity linking,EXT,"The final EL step is a collective disambiguation performed by comparing binary vectors obtained from hand-crafted features, and from each entity's context."
EL,entity linking,EXT,Cucerzan's EL system is still used as baseline for many recent works.
EL,entity linking,EXT,The work of Rao et al. is a well-known paper in the field of EL.
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Similarly to most EL systems, the linking is done in two steps, with an initial candidate entities selection and a linear ranking SVM as second step."
EL,entity linking,EXT,Graph-based EL =
EL,entity linking,EXT,"Modern EL systems do not limit their analysis to textual features generated from input documents or text corpora, but employ large knowledge graphs created from knowledge bases such as Wikipedia."

RS,remote sensing,EXT,"Generally speaking, RS works on the principle of the inverse problem: while the object or phenomenon of interest  may not be directly measured, there exists some other variable that can be detected and measured  which may be related to the object of interest through a calculation."
RS,remote sensing,EXT,The modern discipline of RS arose with the development of flight.

RS,recommender systems,EXT,Similar issues have been spotted also in sequence-aware RS.
RS,recommender systems,EXT,Previous research was also found had little impact on the practical application of RS.

NN,neural network,EXT,"Thus a NN is either a biological NN, made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial NN, for solving artificial intelligence  problems."
NN,neural network,EXT,A biological NN is composed of a groups of chemically connected or functionally associated neurons.
NN,neural network,EXT,"Artificial intelligence, cognitive modeling, and NNs are information processing paradigms inspired by the way biological neural systems process data."
NN,neural network,EXT,Artificial intelligence and cognitive modeling try to simulate some properties of biological NNs.
NN,neural network,EXT,"In the artificial intelligence field, artificial NNs have been applied successfully to speech recognition, image analysis and adaptive control, in order to construct software agents  or autonomous robots."
NN,neural network,EXT,"On the other hand, the origins of NNs are based on efforts to model information processing in biological systems."
NN,neural network,EXT,"Unlike the von Neumann model, NN computing does not separate memory and processing."
NN,neural network,EXT,The preliminary theoretical base for contemporary NNs was independently proposed by Alexander Bain  and William James .
NN,neural network,EXT,McCulloch and Pitts   created a computational model for NNs based on mathematics and algorithms.
NN,neural network,EXT,The model paved the way for NN research to split into two distinct approaches.
NN,neural network,EXT,One approach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on the application of NNs to artificial intelligence.
NN,neural network,EXT,"Other NN computational machines were created by Rochester, Holland, Habit, and Duda ."
NN,neural network,EXT,They discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed NNs.
NN,neural network,EXT,The first issue was that single-layer NNs were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit.
NN,neural network,EXT,The second significant issue was that computers were not sophisticated enough to effectively handle the long run time required by large NNs.
NN,neural network,EXT,"Neural networks, as used in artificial intelligence, have traditionally been viewed as simplified models of neural processing in the brain, even though the relation between this model and brain biological architecture is debated, as it is not clear to what degree artificial NNs mirror brain function."
NN,neural network,EXT,"A NN , in the case of artificial neurons called artificial NN  or simulated NN , is an interconnected group of natural or artificial neurons that uses a mathematical or computational model for information processing based on a connectionistic approach to computation."
NN,neural network,EXT,In more practical terms NNs are non-linear statistical data modeling or decision making tools.
NN,neural network,EXT,"An artificial NN involves a network of simple processing elements  which can exhibit complex global behavior, determined by the connections between the processing elements and element parameters."
NN,neural network,EXT,One classical type of artificial NN is the recurrent Hopfield network.
NN,neural network,EXT,"The concept of a NN appears to have first been proposed by Alan Turing in his 1948 paper Intelligent Machinery in which he called them ""B-type unorganised machines""."
NN,neural network,EXT,The utility of artificial NN models lies in the fact that they can be used to infer a function from observations and also to use it.
NN,neural network,EXT,"Unsupervised NNs can also be used to learn representations of the input that capture the salient characteristics of the input distribution, e.g., see the Boltzmann machine , and more recently, deep learning algorithms, which can implicitly learn the distribution function of the observed data."
NN,neural network,EXT,Learning in NNs is particularly useful in applications where the complexity of the data or task makes the design of such functions by hand impractical.
NN,neural network,EXT,The tasks to which artificial NNs are applied tend to fall within the following broad categories:
NN,neural network,EXT,"In August 2020 scientists reported that bi-directional connections, or added appropriate feedback connections, can accelerate and improve communication between and in modular NNs of the brain's cerebral cortex and lower the threshold for their successful communication."
NN,neural network,EXT,"A common criticism of NNs, particularly in robotics, is that they require a large diversity of training for real-world operation."
NN,neural network,EXT,"Dean Pomerleau, in his research presented in the paper ""Knowledge-based Training of Artificial Neural Networks for Autonomous Robot Driving,"" uses a NN to train a robotic vehicle to drive on multiple types of roads ."
NN,neural network,EXT,"These issues are common in NNs that must decide from amongst a wide variety of responses, but can be dealt with in several ways, for example by randomly shuffling the training examples, by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example, or by grouping examples in so-called mini-batches."
NN,neural network,EXT,"Arguments for Dewdney's position are that to implement large and effective software NNs, much processing and storage resources need to be committed."
NN,neural network,EXT,"While the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons, simulating even a most simplified form on Von Neumann technology may compel a NN designer to fill many millions of database rows for its connections—which can consume vast amounts of computer memory and hard disk space."
NN,neural network,EXT,"Furthermore, the designer of NN systems will often need to simulate the transmission of signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons—which must often be matched with incredible amounts of CPU processing power and time."
NN,neural network,EXT,"While NNs often yield effective programs, they too often do so at the cost of efficiency ."
NN,neural network,EXT,"Although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial NN is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological NN."
NN,neural network,EXT,"Moreover, recent emphasis on the explainability of AI has contributed towards the development of methods, notably those based on attention mechanisms, for visualizing and explaining learned NNs."
NN,neural network,EXT,"Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for NNs are gradually uncovering generic principles that allow a learning machine to be successful."
NN,neural network,EXT,"Between 2009 and 2012, the recurrent NNs and deep feedforward NNs developed in the research group of Jürgen Schmidhuber at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA have won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning."
NN,neural network,EXT,"Such NNs also were the first artificial pattern recognizers to achieve human-competitive or even superhuman performance on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition , or the MNIST handwritten digits problem of Yann LeCun and colleagues at NYU."

NN,nearest neighbor,EXT,"An approximate NN search algorithm is allowed to return points, whose distance from the query is at most"

NN,nearest neighbor,EXT,k-NNs =
NN,nearest neighbor,EXT,k-NN search identifies the top k NNs to the query.
NN,nearest neighbor,EXT,k-NN graphs are graphs in which every point is connected to its k NNs.
NN,nearest neighbor,EXT,Approximate NN =
NN,nearest neighbor,EXT,"In some applications it may be acceptable to retrieve a ""good guess"" of the NN."
NN,nearest neighbor,EXT,"In those cases, we can use an algorithm which doesn't guarantee to return the actual NN in every case, in return for improved speed or memory savings."
NN,nearest neighbor,EXT,"Often such an algorithm will find the NN in a majority of cases, but this depends strongly on the dataset being queried."
NN,nearest neighbor,EXT,"Algorithms that support the approximate NN search include locality-sensitive hashing, best bin first and balanced box-decomposition tree based search."

SA,simulated annealing,EXT,This notion of slow cooling implemented in the SA algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored.

SA,simulated annealing,EXT,The following pseudocode presents the SA heuristic as described above.
SA,simulated annealing,EXT,"In order to apply the SA method to a specific problem, one must specify the following parameters: the state space, the energy  function E, the candidate generator procedure neighbour, the acceptance probability function P, and the annealing schedule temperature AND initial temperature <init temp>."

SA,simulated annealing,EXT,"Moscato and Fontanari conclude from observing the analogous of the ""specific heat"" curve of the ""threshold updating"" annealing originating from their study that ""the stochasticity of the Metropolis updating in the SA algorithm does not play a major role in the search of near-optimal minima""."
SA,simulated annealing,EXT,"Instead, they proposed that ""the smoothening of the cost function landscape at high temperature and the gradual definition of the minima during the cooling process are the fundamental ingredients for the success of SA."
SA,simulated annealing,EXT,"When choosing the candidate generator neighbour, one must consider that after a few iterations of the SA algorithm, the current state is expected to have much lower energy than a random state."

SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,Another method is to use an event-based SA method for variable selection for time-constrained applications.
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,This is an input variable selection  method that assembles together information about the trace of the changes in system inputs and outputs using SA to produce an input/output trigger/event matrix that is designed to map the relationships between input data as causes that trigger events and the output data that describes the actual events.
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"Correlated inputs: Most common SA methods assume independence between model inputs, but sometimes inputs can be strongly correlated."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"Some SA approaches, such as those based on linear regression, can inaccurately measure sensitivity when the model response is nonlinear with respect to its inputs."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"Multiple outputs: Virtually all SA methods consider a single univariate model output, yet many models output a large number of possibly spatially or time-dependent data."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"Given data: While in many cases the practitioner has access to the model, in some instances a SA must be performed with ""given data"", i.e. where the sample points  cannot be chosen by the analyst."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"This may occur when a SA has to be performed retrospectively, perhaps using data from an optimisation or uncertainty analysis, or when data comes from a discrete source."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,In uncertainty and SA there is a crucial trade off between how scrupulous an analyst is in exploring the input assumptions and how wide the resulting inference may be.
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"The point is well illustrated by the econometrician Edward E. Leamer:
I have proposed a form of organized SA that I call 'global SA' in which a neighborhood of alternative assumptions is selected and the corresponding interval of inferences is identified."

SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"Regression analysis, in the context of SA, involves fitting a linear regression to the model response and using standardized regression coefficients as direct measures of sensitivity."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,One of the major shortcomings of the previous SA methods is that none of them considers the spatially ordered structure of the response surface/output of the model Y=f in the parameter space.
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"As a result, the VARS framework accounts for the fact that sensitivity is a scale-dependent concept, and thus overcomes the scale issue of traditional SA methods."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"Some types of emulators that have been used successfully for SA include,"
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"It may happen that a SA of a model-based study is meant to underpin an inference, and to certify its robustness, in a context where the inference feeds into a policy or decision making process."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"In these cases the framing of the analysis itself, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become a matter of great importance, and a pure SA – with its emphasis on parametric uncertainty – may be seen as insufficient."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,"Sensitivity analysis is closely related with uncertainty analysis; while the latter studies the overall uncertainty in the conclusions of the study, SA tries to identify what source of uncertainty weighs more on the study's conclusions."
SA,sensitivity analysis,EXT,The problem setting in SA also has strong similarities with the field of design of experiments.

IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind, it is possible to apply his argument to IP rights, in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another's ideas."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Locke's argument for IP is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Thus, IP ensures this right when it comes to production."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"By providing innovators with ""durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources"", IP rights seek to maximize social utility."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Utilitarians argue that without IP there would be a lack of incentive to produce new ideas.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"European IP law is shaped by this notion that ideas are an ""extension of oneself and of one's personality""."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Writer Ayn Rand argued in her book Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal that the protection of IP is essentially a moral issue.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,The belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is IP.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,To violate IP is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Violation of IP rights, called ""infringement"" with respect to patents, copyright, and trademarks, and ""misappropriation"" with respect to trade secrets, may be a breach of civil law or criminal law, depending on the type of IP involved, jurisdiction, and the nature of the action."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Trade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other IP laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"The term ""IP"" ==="
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Criticism of the term IP ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like property and rights in fashions that contradict practice and law.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman argues that, although the term IP is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it ""systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion""."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"He argues that ""to avoid spreading unnecessary bias and confusion, it is best to adopt a firm policy not to speak or even think in terms of 'IP'."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"On the assumption that IP rights are actual rights, Stallman says that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws, which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system, and later on, a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally, but never interfered with the freedom of average readers."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Stephan Kinsella has objected to IP on the grounds that the word ""property"" implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Entrepreneur and politician Rickard Falkvinge and hacker Alexandre Oliva have independently compared George Orwell's fictional dialect Newspeak to the terminology used by IP supporters as a linguistic weapon to shape public opinion regarding copyright debate and DRM.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"In civil law jurisdictions, IP has often been referred to as intellectual rights, traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included moral rights and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Use of the term intellectual rights has declined since the early 1980s, as use of the term IP has increased."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"The argument that an IP right should  be termed an intellectual monopoly privilege  has been advanced by several academics including Birgitte Andersen and Thomas Alured Faunce.

IP,intellectual property,EXT,Objections to overbroad IP laws
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Some critics of IP, such as those in the free culture movement, point at intellectual monopolies as harming health , preventing progress, and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses, and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Petra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that IP laws may harm innovation:
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Overall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong IP rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,World Intellectual Property Organization  recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current IP systems and other human rights.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"In 2001 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a document called ""Human rights and IP"" that argued that IP tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, IP systems must respect and conform to human rights laws."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Libertarians have differing views on IP.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Stephan Kinsella, an anarcho-capitalist on the right-wing of libertarianism, argues against IP because allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity and infringes on the right to own tangible property."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"In 2005 the RSA launched the Adelphi Charter, aimed at creating an international policy statement to frame how governments should make balanced IP law."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Expansion in nature and scope of IP laws ===
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Other criticism of IP law concerns the expansion of IP, both in duration and in scope."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"Also with respect to copyright, the American film industry helped to change the social construct of IP via its trade organization, the Motion Picture Association of America."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of IP.
IP,intellectual property,EXT,"In contrast, the OECD has spent years developing and advocating IP as a legal and a GAAP accounting concept."
IP,intellectual property,EXT,Libertarian perspectives on IP
IP,inductive programming,EXT,"Depending on the programming language used, there are several kinds of IP."
IP,inductive programming,EXT,"In many applications the output program must be correct with respect to the examples and partial specification,  and this leads to the consideration of IP as a special area inside automatic programming or program synthesis, usually opposed to 'deductive' program synthesis, where the specification is usually complete."
IP,inductive programming,EXT,"In other cases, IP is seen as a more general area where any declarative programming or representation language can be used and we may even have some degree of error in the examples, as in general machine learning, the more specific area of structure mining or the area of symbolic artificial intelligence."
IP,inductive programming,EXT,"Typically, IP techniques can learn from just a few examples."
IP,inductive programming,EXT,"The diversity of IP usually comes from the applications and the languages that are used: apart from logic programming and functional programming, other programming paradigms and representation languages have been used or suggested in IP, such as functional logic programming, constraint programming, probabilistic programming, abductive logic programming, modal logic, action languages, agent languages and many types of imperative languages."
IP,inductive programming,EXT,The idea of genetic programming was further developed into the IP system ADATE and the systematic-search-based system MagicHaskeller.
IP,inductive programming,EXT,"The early work in grammar induction  is related to IP, as rewriting systems or logic programs can be used to represent production rules."
IP,inductive programming,EXT,"More recently, the language learning problem was addressed by the IP community."
IP,inductive programming,EXT,One powerful paradigm that has been recently used for the representation of hypotheses in IP  is probabilistic programming .
IP,inductive programming,EXT,"Since then, these and many other areas have shown to be successful application niches for IP, such as end-user programming, the related areas of programming by example and programming by demonstration, and intelligent tutoring systems."
IP,inverse proportion,EXT,The concept of IPality can be contrasted with direct proportionality.
IP,inverse proportion,EXT,The concepts of direct and IP lead to the location of points in the Cartesian plane by hyperbolic coordinates; the two coordinates correspond to the constant of direct proportionality that specifies a point as being on a particular ray and the constant of IPality that specifies a point as being on a particular hyperbola.
IP,integer programming,EXT,An IP problem is a mathematical optimization or feasibility program in which some or all of the variables are restricted to be integers.
IP,integer programming,EXT,If some decision variables are not discrete the problem is known as a mixed-IP problem.

AL,active learning,EXT,"Active learning is ""a method of learning in which students are actively or experientially involved in the learning process and where there are different levels of AL, depending on student involvement."""
AL,active learning,EXT,"In a report from the Association for the Study of Higher Education , authors discuss a variety of methodologies for promoting AL."
AL,active learning,EXT,Nature of AL =
AL,active learning,EXT,"There are a wide range of alternatives for the term AL, such as: learning through play, technology-based learning, activity-based learning, group work, project method, etc."
AL,active learning,EXT,The common factors in these are some significant qualities and characteristics of AL.
AL,active learning,EXT,"Active learning is the opposite of passive learning; it is learner-centered, not teacher-centered, and requires more than just listening; the active participation of each and every student is a necessary aspect in AL."
AL,active learning,EXT,Many research studies have proven that AL as a strategy has promoted achievement levels and some others say that content mastery is possible through AL strategies.
AL,active learning,EXT,"There is intensive use of scientific and quantitative literacy across the curriculum, and technology-based learning is also in high demand in concern with AL."
AL,active learning,EXT,Barnes  suggested principles of AL:
AL,active learning,EXT,"Studies have shown that immediate results in construction of knowledge is not possible through AL, the child goes through process of knowledge construction, knowledge recording and knowledge absorption."
AL,active learning,EXT,Science of AL ==
AL,active learning,EXT,Each of these principles can be drawn on by various AL exercises.
AL,active learning,EXT,"The argument is ""when should AL exercises be used during instruction?""."
AL,active learning,EXT,"Numerous studies have shown that introducing AL activities  before, rather than after lectures or readings, results in deeper learning, understanding, and transfer."
AL,active learning,EXT,"In an AL environment learners are immersed in experiences within which they engage in meaning-making inquiry, action, imagination, invention, interaction, hypothesizing and personal reflection ."
AL,active learning,EXT,"Examples of ""AL"" activities include

A class discussion may be held in person or in an online environment."
AL,active learning,EXT,This is a good example of AL because it causes the students to review the work that is being required at an earlier time to participate.
AL,active learning,EXT,A reaction to a video is also an example of AL because most students love to watch movies.
AL,active learning,EXT,A small group discussion is also an example of AL because it allows students to express themselves in the classroom.
AL,active learning,EXT,Just-in-time teaching promotes AL by using pre-class questions to create common ground among students and teachers before the class period begins.
AL,active learning,EXT,Learning by teaching is also an example of AL because students actively research a topic and prepare the information so that they can teach it to the class.
AL,active learning,EXT,"The use of multimedia and technology tools helps enhance the atmosphere of the classroom, thus enhancing the AL experience."
AL,active learning,EXT,"Teachers can use movies, videos, games, and other fun activities to enhance the effectiveness of the AL process."
AL,active learning,EXT,"Numerous studies have shown evidence to support AL, given adequate prior instruction."
AL,active learning,EXT,"A meta-analysis of 225 studies comparing traditional lecture to AL in university math, science, and engineering courses found that AL reduces failure rates from 32% to 21%, and increases student performance on course assessments and concept inventories by 0.47 standard deviations."
AL,active learning,EXT,"Richard Hake  reviewed data from over 6000 physics students in 62 introductory physics courses and found that students in classes that utilized AL and interactive engagement techniques improved 25 percent points, achieving an average gain of 48% on a standard test of physics conceptual knowledge, the Force Concept Inventory, compared to a gain of 23% for students in traditional, lecture-based courses."
AL,active learning,EXT,"Similarly, Hoellwarth & Moelter  showed that when instructors switched their physics classes from traditional instruction to AL, student learning improved 38 percent points, from around 12% to over 50%, as measured by the Force Concept Inventory, which has become the standard measure of student learning in physics courses."
AL,active learning,EXT,"Michael , in reviewing the applicability of AL to physiology education, found a ""growing body of research within specific scientific teaching communities that supports and validates the new approaches to teaching that have been adopted""."
AL,active learning,EXT,"In a 2012 report titled ""Engage to Excel"", the United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology  described how improved teaching methods, including engaging students in AL, will increase student retention and improve performance in STEM courses."

MR,majority rule,EXT,"Though plurality  is often mistaken for MR, they are not the same."
MR,majority rule,EXT,This is equivalent to MR when there are only two alternatives.
MR,majority rule,EXT,It is frequently used in legislatures and other bodies in which alternatives can be considered and amended in a process of deliberation until the final version of a proposal is adopted or rejected by MR.
MR,majority rule,EXT,Many referendums are decided by MR.
MR,majority rule,EXT,"According to Kenneth May, MR is the only reasonable decision rule that is ""fair"", that is, that does not privilege voters by letting some votes count for more or privilege an alternative by requiring fewer votes for its passing."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Stated more formally, MR is the only binary decision rule that has the following properties:"
MR,majority rule,EXT,"When using MR, it makes no difference who casts a vote; indeed the voter's identity need not even be known."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Strictly speaking, it has been shown that MR meets these criteria only if the number of voters is odd or infinite."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"That is, it is possible that there are alternatives a, b, and c such that a majority prefers a to b, another majority prefers b to c, and yet another majority prefers c to a.
Because MR requires an alternative to have only majority support to pass, a majority under MR is especially vulnerable to having its decision overturned."
MR,majority rule,EXT," is 3 if the number of voters is different from 4, because the Nakamura number of the MR is 3."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"For superMRs the minimum number is often greater, because the Nakamura number is often greater.)"
MR,majority rule,EXT,"As Rae argued and Taylor proved in 1969, MR is the rule that maximizes the likelihood that the issues a voter votes for will pass and that the issues a voter votes against will fail."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Schmitz and Tröger  consider a collective choice problem with two alternatives and they show that the MR maximizes utilitarian welfare among all incentive compatible, anonymous, and neutral voting rules, provided that the voters’ types are independent."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Yet, when the votersʼ utilities are stochastically correlated, other dominant-strategy choice rules may perform better than the MR."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Because a majority can win a vote under MR, it has been commonly argued that MR can lead to a tyranny of the majority."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Supermajoritarian rules, such as the three-fifths superMR required to end a filibuster in the United States Senate, have been proposed as preventative measures of this problem."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"SuperMRs do not guarantee that it is a minority that will be protected by the superMR; they only establish that one of two alternatives is the status quo, and privilege it against being overturned by a mere majority."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Anthony McGann argues that when there are multiple minorities and one is protected  by the superMR, there is no guarantee that the protected minority won't be one that is already privileged, and if nothing else"
MR,majority rule,EXT,"In response, advocates of unfettered MR argue that because the procedure that privileges constitutional rights is generally some sort of supermajoritarian rule, this solution inherits whatever problems this rule would have."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Some argue that MR can lead to poor deliberation practice or even to ""an aggressive culture and conflict""."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Along these lines, some have asserted that MR fails to measure the intensity of preferences."
MR,majority rule,EXT,SuperMRs are often used in binary decisions where a positive decision is weightier than a negative one.
MR,majority rule,EXT,"McGann argues that MR helps to protect minority rights, at least in settings in which deliberation occurs."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"To support the view that MR protects minority rights better than superMRs McGann points to the cloture rule in the US Senate, which was used to prevent the extension of civil liberties to racial minorities."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Ben Saunders, while agreeing that MR may offer better protection than superMRs, argues that MR may nonetheless be of little help to the most despised minorities in a group."
MR,majority rule,EXT,Some argue that deliberative democracy flourishes under MR.
MR,majority rule,EXT,"They argue that under MR, participants always have to convince more than half the group at the very least, while under supermajoritarian rules participants might only need to persuade a minority."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Another argument for MR is that within this atmosphere of compromise, there will be times when a minority faction will want to support the proposal of another faction in exchange for support of a proposal it believes to be vital."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"Because it would be in the best interest of such a faction to report the true intensity of its preference, so the argument goes, MR differentiates weak and strong preferences."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"McGann argues that situations such as these give minorities incentive to participate, because there are few permanent losers under MR, and so MR leads to systemic stability."
MR,majority rule,EXT,"He points to governments that use MR which largely goes unchecked—the governments of the Netherlands, Austria, and Sweden, for example—as empirical evidence of MR's stability."

HR,heart rate,EXT,"The HR can vary according to the body's physical needs, including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide, but is also modulated by a myriad of factors including but not limited to genetics, physical fitness, stress or psychological status, diet, drugs, hormonal status, environment, and disease/illness as well as the interaction between and among these factors."
HR,heart rate,EXT,The American Heart Association states the normal resting adult human HR is 60–100 bpm.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Tachycardia is a high HR, defined as above 100 bpm at rest."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Bradycardia is a low HR, defined as below 60 bpm at rest."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Abnormalities of HR sometimes indicate disease.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"While heart rhythm is regulated entirely by the sinoatrial node under normal conditions, HR is regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the sinoatrial node."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Therefore, stimulation of the accelerans nerve increases HR, while stimulation of the vagus nerve decreases it."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Due to individuals having a constant blood volume, one of the physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase HR to permit blood to pass by the organ more often."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Normal resting HRs range from 60-100 bpm.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Bradycardia is defined as a resting HR below 60 bpm.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"However, HRs from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention."

HR,heart rate,EXT,The HR is rhythmically generated by the sinoatrial node.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Nervous influence over the HR is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata.
HR,heart rate,EXT,High blood pressure medications are used to block these receptors and so reduce the HR.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Factors influencing HR
HR,heart rate,EXT,"===

Using a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise control over the HR, but other factors can impact on this."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"In general, increased levels of the thyroid hormones  and triiodothyronine ), increase the HR; excessive levels can trigger tachycardia."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Calcium ion levels have a great impact on HR and contractility: increased calcium levels cause an increase in both.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Caffeine and nicotine are both stimulants of the nervous system and of the cardiac centres causing an increased HR.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Both surprise and stress induce physiological response: elevate HR substantially.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"In a study conducted on 8 female and male student actors ages 18 to 25, their reaction to an unforeseen occurrence  during a performance was observed in terms of HR."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"In the data collected, there was a noticeable trend between the location of actors  and their elevation in HR in response to stress; the actors present offstage reacted to the stressor immediately, demonstrated by their immediate elevation in HR the minute the unexpected event occurred, but the actors present onstage at the time of the stressor reacted in the following 5 minute period ."
HR,heart rate,EXT,This trend regarding stress and HR is supported by previous studies; negative emotion/stimulus has a prolonged effect on HR in individuals who are directly impacted.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"In regard to the characters present onstage, a reduced startle response has been associated with a passive defense, and the diminished initial HR response has been predicted to have a greater tendency to dissociation."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Further, note that HR is an accurate measure of stress and the startle response which can be easily observed to determine the effects of certain stressors."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Factors decreasing HR
HR,heart rate,EXT,"The HR can be slowed by altered sodium and potassium levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and hypothermia."
HR,heart rate,EXT,A number of different metrics are used to describe HR.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Resting HR =
HR,heart rate,EXT,"The basal or resting HR  is defined as the HR when a person is awake, in a neutrally temperate environment, and has not been subject to any recent exertion or stimulation, such as stress or surprise."
HR,heart rate,EXT,The available evidence indicates that the normal range for resting HR is 50-90 beats per minute.
HR,heart rate,EXT,This resting HR is often correlated with mortality.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"For example, all-cause mortality is increased by 1.22  when HR exceeds 90 beats per minute."
HR,heart rate,EXT,The mortality rate of patients with myocardial infarction increased from 15% to 41% if their admission HR was greater than 90 beats per minute.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"ECG of 46,129 individuals with low risk for cardiovascular disease revealed that 96% had resting HRs ranging from 48-98 beats per minute."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"The normal resting HR is based on the at-rest firing rate of the heart's sinoatrial node, where the faster pacemaker cells driving the self-generated rhythmic firing and responsible for the heart's autorhythmicity are located."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"For endurance athletes at the elite level, it is not unusual to have a resting HR between 33 and 50 bpm."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Maximum HR ===
HR,heart rate,EXT,"The maximum HR  is the highest HR an individual can achieve without severe problems through exercise stress, and generally decreases with age."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Adults who are beginning a new exercise regimen are often advised to perform this test only in the presence of medical staff due to risks associated with high HRs.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"For general purposes, a formula is often employed to estimate a person's maximum HR."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"It is well-established that there is a ""poor relationship between maximal HR and age"" and large standard deviations relative to predicted HRs."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"In 2007, researchers at the Oakland University analyzed maximum HRs of 132 individuals recorded yearly over 25 years, and produced a linear equation very similar to the Tanaka formula, HRmax ="
HR,heart rate,EXT,"It gained widespread use through being used by Polar Electro in its HR monitors, which Dr. Haskell has ""laughed about"", as the formula ""was never supposed to be an absolute guide to rule people's training."
HR,heart rate,EXT,", in 2010 suggested a maximum HR formula for women:"
HR,heart rate,EXT,Maximum HRs vary significantly between individuals.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Even within a single elite sports team, such as Olympic rowers in their 20s, maximum HRs have been reported as varying from 160 to 220."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"While each may have predicted HRs of 180 , these two people could have actual HRmax 20 beats apart ."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Further, note that individuals of the same age, the same training, in the same sport, on the same team, can have actual HRmax 60 bpm apart : the range is extremely broad, and some say ""The HR is probably the least important variable in comparing athletes."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Heart rate reserve  is the difference between a person's measured or predicted maximum HR and resting HR.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Some methods of measurement of exercise intensity measure percentage of HR reserve.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Additionally, as a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HRrest will drop, and the HR reserve will increase."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Target HR
HR,heart rate,EXT,"For healthy people, the Target Heart Rate or Training Heart Rate  is a desired range of HR reached during aerobic exercise which enables one's heart and lungs to receive the most benefit from a workout."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"The Karvonen method factors in resting HR  to calculate target HR , using a range of 50–85% intensity:"
HR,heart rate,EXT,"An alternative to the Karvonen method is the Zoladz method, which is used to test an athlete's capabilities at specific HRs."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Heart rate recovery  is the reduction in HR at peak exercise and the rate as measured after a cool-down period of fixed duration.
HR,heart rate,EXT,A greater reduction in HR after exercise during the reference period is associated with a higher level of cardiac fitness.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"The embryonic HR then accelerates linearly for the first month of beating, peaking at 165–185 bpm during the early 7th week, ."
HR,heart rate,EXT,There is no difference in male and female HRs before birth.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"The thumb should not be used for measuring another person's HR, as its strong pulse may interfere with the correct perception of the target pulse."
HR,heart rate,EXT,The radial artery is the easiest to use to check the HR.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"However, in emergency situations the most reliable arteries to measure HR are carotid arteries."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Possible points for measuring the HR are:
HR,heart rate,EXT,"A more precise method of determining HR involves the use of an electrocardiograph, or ECG ."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"On the ECG, instantaneous HR is calculated using the R wave-to-R wave  interval and multiplying/dividing in order to derive HR in heartbeats/min."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Various commercial HR monitors are also available.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Those techniques can assess the HR by measuring the delay between pulses.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Tachycardia is a resting HR more than 100 beats per minute.
HR,heart rate,EXT,This number can vary as smaller people and children have faster HRs than average adults.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"==

Bradycardia was defined as a HR less than 60 beats per minute when textbooks asserted that the normal range for HRs was 60–100 bpm."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Setting a lower threshold for bradycardia prevents misclassification of fit individuals as having a pathologic HR.
HR,heart rate,EXT,The normal HR number can vary as children and adolescents tend to have faster HRs than average adults.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Trained athletes tend to have slow resting HRs, and resting bradycardia in athletes should not be considered abnormal if the individual has no symptoms associated with it."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"For example, Miguel Indurain, a Spanish cyclist and five time Tour de France winner, had a resting HR of 28 beats per minute, one of the lowest ever recorded in a healthy human."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Daniel Green achieved the world record for the slowest heartbeat in a healthy human with a HR of just 26 bpm in 2014.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Arrhythmias are abnormalities of the HR and rhythm .
HR,heart rate,EXT,They can be divided into two broad categories: fast and slow HRs.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"A number of investigations indicate that faster resting HR has emerged as a new risk factor for mortality in homeothermic mammals, particularly cardiovascular mortality in human beings."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Faster HR may accompany increased production of inflammation molecules and increased production of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular system, in addition to increased mechanical stress to the heart."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Those patients whose HR was above 70 beats per minute had significantly higher incidence of heart attacks, hospital admissions and the need for surgery."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Higher HR is thought to be correlated with an increase in heart attack and about a 46 percent increase in hospitalizations for non-fatal or fatal heart attack.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Other studies have shown that a high resting HR is associated with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic diseases.
HR,heart rate,EXT,"A faster resting HR is associated with shorter life expectancy  and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure, independent of level of physical fitness."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Specifically, a resting HR above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting HR has been shown to be associated with a 10–20% increase in risk of death."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting HR of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Similarly, another study found that men with resting HRs of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it was associated with a three-fold increase."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Given these data, HR should be considered in the assessment of cardiovascular risk, even in apparently healthy individuals."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"Although the accepted limits of HR are between 60 and 100 beats per minute, this was based for convenience on the scale of the squares on electrocardiogram paper; a better definition of normal sinus HR may be between 50 and 90 beats per minute."
HR,heart rate,EXT,Standard textbooks of physiology and medicine mention that HR  is readily calculated from the ECG as follows:
HR,heart rate,EXT,Lifestyle and pharmacological regimens may be beneficial to those with high resting HRs.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Exercise is one possible measure to take when an individual's HR is higher than 80 beats per minute.
HR,heart rate,EXT,Diet has also been found to be beneficial in lowering resting HR:
HR,heart rate,EXT,"In studies of resting HR and risk of death and cardiac complications on patients with type 2 diabetes, legumes were found to lower resting HR."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"In a meta-analysis with a total of 51 randomized controlled trials  involvingy 3,000 participants, the supplement mildly but significantly reduced HR ."
HR,heart rate,EXT,"When docosahexaenoic acid  and eicosapentaenoic acid  were compared, modest HR reduction was observed in trials that supplemented with DHA (-2.47 bpm;"

  therefore, a good probability change P in IS will redistribute the law of X so that its samples' frequencies are sorted directly according to their weights in E."
IS,importance sampling,EXT,"Hence the name ""IS."""
IS,importance sampling,EXT,The idea behind IS is that certain values of the input random variables in a simulation have more impact on the parameter being estimated than others.
IS,importance sampling,EXT,"Hence, the basic methodology in IS is to choose a distribution which ""encourages"" the important values."
IS,importance sampling,EXT,"However, the simulation outputs are weighted to correct for the use of the biased distribution, and this ensures that the new IS estimator is unbiased."
IS,importance sampling,EXT,The fundamental issue in implementing IS simulation is the choice of the biased distribution which encourages the important regions of the input variables.
IS,importance sampling,EXT,"Choosing or designing a good biased distribution is the ""art"" of IS."

SD,standard deviation,EXT,The mean and the SD of a set of data are descriptive statistics usually reported together.
SD,standard deviation,EXT,"In a certain sense, the SD is a ""natural"" measure of statistical dispersion if the center of the data is measured about the mean."

ST,stomach,EXT,"In humans and many other animals, the ST is located between the oesophagus and the small intestine."
ST,stomach,EXT,The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food  from the ST into the duodenum where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of the intestines.
ST,stomach,EXT,"In humans, the ST lies between the oesophagus and the duodenum ."
ST,stomach,EXT,The top of the ST lies against the diaphragm.
ST,stomach,EXT,Lying behind the ST is the pancreas.
ST,stomach,EXT,A large double fold of visceral peritoneum called the greater omentum hangs down from the greater curvature of the ST.
ST,stomach,EXT,Two sphincters keep the contents of the ST contained;
ST,stomach,EXT,"the lower oesophageal sphincter  , at the junction of the oesophagus and ST, and the pyloric sphincter at the junction of the ST with the duodenum."
ST,stomach,EXT,"The ST is surrounded by parasympathetic  and sympathetic  plexuses , which regulate both the secretory activity of the ST and the motor  activity of its muscles."
ST,stomach,EXT,The ST of a newborn human baby will only be able to retain about 30 millilitres.
ST,stomach,EXT,The maximum ST volume in adults is between 2 and 4 litres.
ST,stomach,EXT,"In classical anatomy the human ST is divided into four sections, beginning at the cardia."
ST,stomach,EXT,The cardia is where the contents of the esophagus empty into the ST.
ST,stomach,EXT,"The body is the main, central region of the ST."
ST,stomach,EXT,The pylorus  is the lower section of the ST that empties contents into the duodenum.
ST,stomach,EXT,Recent research has shown that the cardia is not an anatomically distinct region of the ST but a region of the oesophageal lining damaged by reflux.
ST,stomach,EXT,The ST bed refers to the structures upon which the  ST rests in mammals.
ST,stomach,EXT,"The lesser curvature of the human ST is supplied by the right gastric artery inferiorly and the left gastric artery superiorly, which also supplies the cardiac region."
ST,stomach,EXT,"The fundus of the ST, and also the upper portion of the greater curvature, is supplied by the short gastric arteries, which arise from the splenic artery."
ST,stomach,EXT,"Like the other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the human ST walls consist of a mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, subserosa and serosa."
ST,stomach,EXT,"The inner part of the lining of the ST, the gastric mucosa, consists of an outer layer of column-shaped cells, a lamina propria, and a thin layer of smooth muscle called the muscularis mucosa."
ST,stomach,EXT,This layer is concentric to the longitudinal axis of the ST.
ST,stomach,EXT,Auerbach's plexus  is found between the outer longitudinal and the middle circular layer and is responsible for the innervation of both The outer longitudinal layer is responsible for moving the bolus towards the pylorus of the ST through muscular shortening.
ST,stomach,EXT,"The mucosa lining the ST is lined with a number of these pits, which receive gastric juice, secreted by between 2 and 7 gastric glands."
ST,stomach,EXT,"The glands contains a number of cells, with the function of the glands changing depending on their position within the ST."
ST,stomach,EXT,Within the body and fundus of the ST lie the fundic glands.
ST,stomach,EXT,"Glands differ where the ST meets the oesophagus, and near the pylorus."
ST,stomach,EXT,"Near the junction between the ST and the oesophagus lie cardiac glands, which primarily secrete mucus."

About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal ST."
ST,stomach,EXT,"Just over 150 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the ST compared to other organs, with only some 20 genes being highly specific."
ST,stomach,EXT,The corresponding specific proteins expressed in ST are mainly involved in creating a suitable environment for handling the digestion of food for uptake of nutrients.
ST,stomach,EXT,"Highly ST-specific proteins include GKN1, expressed in the mucosa; pepsinogen PGC and the lipase LIPF, expressed in chief cells; and gastric ATPase ATP4A and gastric intrinsic factor GIF, expressed in parietal cells."
ST,stomach,EXT,"Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, and the esophagus, and ST form from the foregut."
ST,stomach,EXT,"In the human digestive system, a bolus  enters the ST through the esophagus via the lower esophageal sphincter."
ST,stomach,EXT,"The ST releases proteases  and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria and provides the acidic pH of 2 for the proteases to work."
ST,stomach,EXT,"Food is churned by the ST through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis – reducing the volume of the bolus, before looping around the fundus and the body of ST as the boluses are converted into chyme ."
ST,stomach,EXT,Gastric juice in the ST also contains pepsinogen.
ST,stomach,EXT,"Although the absorption in the human digestive system is mainly a function of the small intestine, some absorption of certain small molecules nevertheless does occur in the ST through its lining."
ST,stomach,EXT,"To a small extent water-soluble vitamins The parietal cells of the human ST are responsible for producing intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12."
ST,stomach,EXT,The movement and the flow of chemicals into the ST are controlled by both the autonomic nervous system and by the various digestive hormones of the digestive system:
ST,stomach,EXT,"Other than gastrin, these hormones all act to turn off the ST action."
ST,stomach,EXT,The ST needs to push food into the small intestine only when the intestine is not busy.
ST,stomach,EXT,"While the intestine is full and still digesting food, the ST acts as storage for food."
ST,stomach,EXT,"sensorThe human ST can ""taste"" sodium glutamate using glutamate receptors and this information is passed to the lateral hypothalamus and limbic system in the brain as a palatability signal through the vagus nerve."
ST,stomach,EXT,"The ST can also sense, independently of tongue and oral taste receptors, glucose, carbohydrates,  proteins, and fats."
ST,stomach,EXT,"In 1993, has been published a more complete investigation on the ST and thyroid  , reporting that the thyroid is, embryogenetically and  phylogenetically, derived from primitive ST, and that the thyroid cells, such as primitive gastroenteric cells, during vertebrate evolution, migrated and specialized in uptake of iodide and in storage and elaboration of iodine compounds."
ST,stomach,EXT,"In fact, ST and thyroid share iodine-concentranting ability and many morphological and functional similarities,  such as cell polarity and apical microvilli, similar organ-specific antigens and also associated autoimmune diseases, secretion of glycoproteins  and peptide hormones, the digesting and readsorbing ability and, lastly, similar ability to form iodotyrosines by peroxidase activity, where iodide acts as electron donor in the presence of H2O2."
ST,stomach,EXT,A series of radiographs can be used to examine the ST for various disorders.
ST,stomach,EXT,"Another method of examination of the ST, is the use of an endoscope."

ST,stomach,EXT,"In humans, many bariatric surgery procedures involve the ST, in order to lose weight."
ST,stomach,EXT,"The anatomy of the ST may be modified, or the ST may be bypassed entirely."
ST,stomach,EXT,"Surgical removal of the ST is called a gastrectomy, and removal of the cardia area is a called a cardiectomy."
ST,stomach,EXT,A gastrectomy may be carried out because of gastric cancer or severe perforation of the ST wall.
ST,stomach,EXT,Fundoplication is ST surgery in which the fundus is wrapped around the lower esophagus and stitched into place.
ST,stomach,EXT,"There were previously conflicting statements in the academic anatomy community over whether the cardia is part of the ST, part of the oesophagus or a distinct entity."
ST,stomach,EXT,"Modern surgical and medical textbooks have agreed that ""the gastric cardia is now clearly considered to be part of the ST.""

ST,stomach,EXT,"The word ST is derived from the Latin STus which has roots from the Greek word STos , ultimately from stoma , ""mouth""."
ST,stomach,EXT,"Although the precise shape and size of the ST varies widely among different vertebrates, the relative positions of the oesophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant."
ST,stomach,EXT,"However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no ST at all, with the oesophagus opening directly into the anus."

ST,smart thermostat,EXT,Manual vs. programmable vs. STs =
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,One of the main objectives of STs is to reduce the issues involved with using traditional programmable thermostats.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"In order to understand how STs take on this task, it is important to understand the issues regarding programmable thermostats and how they affect energy consumption."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,The ST attempts to combat this issue by taking the user out of the picture and relying on sensors and computers to save energy.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,It became the goal of STs to address these issues by taking the human out of the picture and creating a thermostat that uses smart computing to truly reduce energy usage and cost.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"In addition to this feature, STs implement other technologies to reduce the amount of human error involved with using programmable thermostats."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Additionally, STs utilize Wi-Fi connectivity to give the user access to the thermostat at all times."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,These additional technologies have proven to make STs successful in saving users energy and money.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,Development of the ST began in 2007 with the creation of the ecobee thermostat.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Following difficulties with the programmable thermostat, he set out to create a ST that saved energy and was easy to use."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Following the ecobee, EnergyHub released its version of a ST in 2009 with the creation of the EnergyHub Dashboard."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,The programmable schedule feature on the ST is similar to that on standard programmable thermostats.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"To avoid this problem, STs also provide an auto schedule feature."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"By taking the human error out of the scheduling, STs can create smart schedules that actually save energy."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"In an attempt to mitigate the issues with human error involved with programmable thermostats, the ST utilizes a sensor that can determine occupancy patterns to automatically change the temperature based on occupant patterns and behaviors."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,Another major feature of STs is their ability to connect to the internet.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"The WiFi feature also has the ability to send reports on energy usage and HVAC system performance via the web portal, informing the user on their energy efficiency and how it compares to other ST users."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,Another feature offered by some STs through the internet connection is geofencing.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,The benefit of having a ST with geofencing capabilities is that it uses a users smartphone location to determine whether the home is occupied.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Instead of using a schedule or sensor to determine occupancy, the ST can rely on the location of the geofence to tell the HVAC system whether it needs to be on or off."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Some STs, such as the Nest thermostat, can learn when the house is likely to be occupied, and when it is likely to be empty."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"If the residents or lifestyles change, these STs will gradually adjust the schedule, maintaining energy savings and comfort."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"One ST that uses motion detectors is the Ecobee4.A wireless network can be used to sense when someone is out of range, thus determining if they're in or nearby their home."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"The market of STs is expected to reach around 3.5 Billion USD by the end of  the year 2022.


=="
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"To show that their thermostats save energy and money, numerous ST producers have conducted models and studies to confirm their savings claims."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,One popular way that ST producers calculate energy usage is through energy modeling.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"In these models, the ST is compared to a thermostat set at a constant temperature, and savings are calculated."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Upon conducting this model, ecobee determined a 23% savings on heating and cooling costs for those who switch to their ST."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"While the results from the MyEnergy study are significantly lower than those from energy modeling, both show a savings in energy usage by switching to a ST."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Since the release of STs, a number of third party studies have been conducted to determine if STs actually save energy and how they compare to manual and programmable thermostats with regards to savings."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,One study conducted an experiment in which 300 standard programmable thermostats were placed in homes and 300 Nest STs were placed in other homes.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,This study helps to suggest that STs are in fact successful in reducing energy consumption.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,A similar study conducted in 2012 with the ecobee thermostat also concluded that STs are capable of saving energy.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,The goal of this pilot program was to determine the gas and electric savings of STs.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Although these studies report differing amounts of savings compared to the internal studies conducted by Nest and ecobee, both of these studies show that STs have the potential to save energy."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Although most studies show that STs show an energy savings, the amount of savings varies."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"The energy modeling compares the ST to a constant set point temperature of 72 °F, but an online survey conducted by Nest showed that most users have a set point temperature that is 10% more efficient."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,This greater interest in energy efficiency may lead to lower energy savings by switching to a ST.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"The most energy-conscious customers are the ones more likely to have had efficient thermostat settings, therefore, the savings that they receive from the ST may not be as great."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,One issue with using a ST is the unreliability of the motion sensor.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,One of the main features of the ST is the ability to change the temperature when the sensor in the thermostat does not sense an occupant.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,The study compared a standard  ST and the multiple sensor system to a manual thermostat.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"The study concluded that a reactive ST with just on sensor saves, on average, 6.8% of energy consumption, while the multiple sensor system saved an average of 28% of energy consumption."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"This study again shows that, on average, STs achieve their goal of saving energy."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"It also shows that STs are not as well developed as they could be, and the addition of more sensors could result in better performance and energy savings."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,One of the issues with programmable thermostats that STs try to fix is the confusing user interface.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,Developers of STs have attempted to fix this issue by creating simple to use thermostats and providing proper direction.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Additionally, many STs use a web portal where users can adjust the thermostat settings and look at their energy usage history."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Additionally, the technology within STs has proven to provide optimal occupant comfort, while still reducing energy consumption."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"By relying on technology instead of human actions, STs reduce the amount of human error often experienced with other sustainable devices, such as the programmable thermostat."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"These factors suggest that installing a ST is one easy step than many people can take to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions, ultimately leading to a more sustainable future."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Many housing corporations and ST developers realize the potential of STs to save energy, and have developed programs to advance sustainability through smarter technology."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,Another popular way that utility companies promote switching to a ST is through monetary incentives.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,The San Diego Gas & Electric company currently runs a program that offers participants a $50 e-gift card after switching to a ST.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,The Wisconsin Focus on Energy program partners with utility companies across Wisconsin to offer a $75 check to those who purchase a qualifying ST.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Austin Energy, a utility company providing electricity to the city of Austin, Texas, offers a $25 rebate for each eligible ST that is purchased and installed."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,Many other companies across the United States offer similar programs to incentive STs and more sustainable heating and cooling.
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"Upon installing a ST, there are additional programs that continue to promote sustainability and reduced energy consumption."
ST,smart thermostat,EXT,"As more programs like these are created, STs will play an increasingly important role in reducing residential energy consumption."

CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"In the newer, narrower sense, CF is a method of making automatic predictions  about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users ."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"The underlying assumption of the CF approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"For example, a CF recommendation system for television tastes could make predictions about which television show a user should like given a partial list of that user's tastes ."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"In the more general sense, CF is the process of filtering for information or patterns using techniques involving collaboration among multiple agents, viewpoints, data sources, etc."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,Applications of CF typically involve very large data sets.
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"The remainder of this discussion focuses on CF for user data, although some of the methods and approaches may apply to the other major applications as well."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,The motivation for CF comes from the idea that people often get the best recommendations from someone with tastes similar to themselves.
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"Typically, the workflow of a CF system is:

A user expresses his or her preferences by rating items  of the system."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"With similar users, the system recommends items that the similar users have rated highly but not yet being rated by this user A key problem of CF is how to combine and weight the preferences of user neighbors."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,Use the ratings from those like-minded users found in step 1 to calculate a prediction for the active userThis falls under the category of user-based CF.
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"Alternatively, item-based CF , proceeds in an item-centric manner:"
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"Infer the tastes of the current user by examining the matrix and matching that user's dataSee, for example, the Slope One item-based CF family."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,Another form of CF can be based on implicit observations of normal user behavior .

CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"In order to take advantage of CF and particularly neighborhood-based methods, approaches can be extended from two dimensional rating matrix into tensor of higher order."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"Services like Reddit, YouTube, and Last.fm are typical examples of CF based media."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,One scenario of CF application is to recommend interesting or popular information as judged by the community.
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"Another aspect of CF systems is the ability to generate more personalized recommendations by analyzing information from the past activity of a specific user, or the history of other users deemed to be of similar taste to a given user."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,A CF system does not necessarily succeed in automatically matching content to one's preferences.
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"As in the personalized recommendation scenario, the introduction of new users or new items can cause the cold start problem, as there will be insufficient data on these new entries for the CF to work accurately."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,The CF system requires a substantial number of users to rate a new item before that item can be recommended.
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"As a result, the user-item matrix used for CF could be extremely large and sparse, which brings about the challenges in the performances of the recommendation."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,"As CF methods recommend items based on users' past preferences,  new users will need to rate sufficient number of items to enable the system to capture their preferences accurately and thus provides reliable recommendations."
CF,collaborative filtering,EXT,Gray sheep refers to the users whose opinions do not consistently agree or disagree with any group of people and thus do not benefit from CF.

CF,crest factor,EXT,"Many modulation techniques have been specifically designed to have constant envelope modulation, i.e., the minimum possible CF of 1:1."
CF,crest factor,EXT,"In general, modulation techniques that have smaller CFs usually transmit more bits per second than modulation techniques that have higher CFs."
CF,crest factor,EXT,"the average power of the signal is the peak output power divided by the CF;
the number of bits per second transmitted  is proportional to the average power transmitted .Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing  is a very promising modulation technique; perhaps its biggest problem is its high CF."

LR,logistic regression,EXT,Ordinal LR deals with dependent variables that are ordered.
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"In binary LR, the outcome is usually coded as ""0"" or ""1"", as this leads to the most straightforward interpretation."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,Binary LR is used to predict the odds of being a case based on the values of the independent variables .
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"Like other forms of regression analysis, LR makes use of one or more predictor variables that may be either continuous or categorical."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"Unlike ordinary linear regression, however, LR is used for predicting dependent variables that take membership in one of a limited number of categories  rather than a continuous outcome."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"To do that, binomial LR first calculates the odds of the event happening for different levels of each independent variable, and then takes its logarithm to create a continuous criterion as a transformed version of the dependent variable."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"Although the dependent variable in LR is Bernoulli, the logit is on an unrestricted scale."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"Thus, although the observed dependent variable in binary LR is a 0-or-1 variable, the LR estimates the odds, as a continuous variable, that the dependent variable is a ‘success’."

LR,logistic regression,EXT,Deviance is analogous to the sum of squares calculations in linear regression  and is a measure of the lack of fit to the data in a LR model.
LR,logistic regression,EXT,Two measures of deviance are particularly important in LR: null deviance and model deviance.
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"In LR analysis, there is no agreed upon analogous measure, but there are several competing measures each with limitations."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"Therefore, it is inappropriate to think of R² as a proportionate reduction in error in a universal sense in LR."

LR,logistic regression,EXT,"Although some common statistical packages  do provide likelihood ratio test statistics, without this computationally intensive test it would be more difficult to assess the contribution of individual predictors in the multiple LR case."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"There are various equivalent specifications of LR, which fit into different types of more general models."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,The basic setup of LR is as follows.
LR,logistic regression,EXT,The goal of LR is to use the dataset to create a predictive model of the outcome variable.
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"Theoretically, this could cause problems, but in reality almost all LR models are fitted with regularization constraints.)"
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"Linear predictor functionThe basic idea of LR is to use the mechanism already developed for linear regression by modeling the probability pi using a linear predictor function, i.e. a linear combination of the explanatory variables and a set of regression coefficients that are specific to the model at hand but the same for all trials."

  This formulation—which is standard in discrete choice models—makes clear the relationship between LR  and the probit model, which uses an error variable distributed according to a standard normal distribution instead of a standard logistic distribution."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"The reason for this separation is that it makes it easy to extend LR to multi-outcome categorical variables, as in the multinomial logit model."
LR,logistic regression,EXT,"It is also possible to motivate each of the separate latent variables as the theoretical utility associated with making the associated choice, and thus motivate LR in terms of utility theory."

LR,linear regression,EXT,"In effect, residuals appear clustered and spread apart on their predicted plots for larger and smaller values for points along the LR line, and the mean squared error for the model will be wrong."
LR,linear regression,EXT,Simple LR estimation methods give less precise parameter estimates and misleading inferential quantities such as standard errors when substantial heteroscedasticity is present.
LR,linear regression,EXT,Bayesian LR techniques can also be used when the variance is assumed to be a function of the mean.
LR,linear regression,EXT,Bayesian LR is a general way of handling this issue.

OS,operating system,EXT,"In preemptive multitasking, the OS slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot to each of the programs."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Unix-like OSs, such as Solaris and Linux—as well as non-Unix-like, such as AmigaOS—support preemptive multitasking."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Single-user OSs have no facilities to distinguish users, but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem."
OS,operating system,EXT,"A multi-user OS extends the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and resources, such as disk space, belonging to multiple users, and the system permits multiple users to interact with the system at the same time."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Time-sharing OSs schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources to multiple users."
OS,operating system,EXT,"A distributed OS manages a group of distinct, networked computers and makes them appear to be a single computer, as all computations are distributed ."

OS,operating system,EXT,Embedded OSs are designed to be used in embedded computer systems.
OS,operating system,EXT,Windows CE and Minix 3 are some examples of embedded OSs.
OS,operating system,EXT,A real-time OS is an OS that guarantees to process events or data by a specific moment in time.
OS,operating system,EXT,"A real-time OS may be single- or multi-tasking, but when multitasking, it uses specialized scheduling algorithms so that a deterministic nature of behavior is achieved."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Such an event-driven system switches between tasks based on their priorities or external events, whereas time-sharing OSs switch tasks based on clock interrupts."
OS,operating system,EXT,"A library OS is one in which the services that a typical OS provides, such as networking, are provided in the form of libraries and composed with the application and configuration code to construct a unikernel: a specialized, single address space, machine image that can be deployed to cloud or embedded environments."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Basic OS features were developed in the 1950s, such as resident monitor functions that could automatically run different programs in succession to speed up processing."
OS,operating system,EXT,"When personal computers became popular in the 1980s, OSs were made for them similar in concept to those used on larger computers."
OS,operating system,EXT,"In the 1940s, the earliest electronic digital systems had no OSs."
OS,operating system,EXT,"It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine, and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an OS from the principles of the universal Turing machine."
OS,operating system,EXT,This was the genesis of the modern-day OS.
OS,operating system,EXT,"Introduced with the Manchester Atlas in 1962, it is considered by many to be the first recognisable modern OS."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Brinch Hansen described it as ""the most significant breakthrough in the history of OSs."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Through the 1950s, many major features were pioneered in the field of OSs on mainframe computers, including batch processing, input/output interrupting, buffering, multitasking, spooling, runtime libraries, link-loading, and programs for sorting records in files."
OS,operating system,EXT,"These features were included or not included in application software at the option of application programmers, rather than in a separate OS used by all applications."
OS,operating system,EXT,"IBM's current mainframe OSs are distant descendants of this original system and modern machines are backwards-compatible with applications written for OS/360.OS/360 also pioneered the concept that the OS keeps track of all of the system resources that are used, including program and data space allocation in main memory and file space in secondary storage, and file locking during updates."
OS,operating system,EXT,"When a process is terminated for any reason, all of these resources are re-claimed by the OS."
OS,operating system,EXT,The alternative CP-67 system for the S/360-67 started a whole line of IBM OSs focused on the concept of virtual machines.
OS,operating system,EXT,"Other OSs used on IBM S/360 series mainframes included systems developed by IBM: COS/360 , DOS/360 ,"
OS,operating system,EXT,"Control Data Corporation developed the SCOPE OS in the 1960s, for batch processing."
OS,operating system,EXT,"In cooperation with the University of Minnesota, the Kronos and later the NOS OSs were developed during the 1970s, which supported simultaneous batch and timesharing use."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Like many commercial timesharing systems, its interface was an extension of the Dartmouth BASIC OSs, one of the pioneering efforts in timesharing and programming languages."
OS,operating system,EXT,"In the late 1970s, Control Data and the University of Illinois developed the PLATO OS, which used plasma panel displays and long-distance time sharing networks."

OS,operating system,EXT,"Digital Equipment Corporation developed many OSs for its various computer lines, including TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 time sharing systems for the 36-bit PDP-10 class systems."
OS,operating system,EXT,The enormous investment in software for these systems made since the 1960s caused most of the original computer manufacturers to continue to develop compatible OSs along with the hardware.
OS,operating system,EXT,Notable supported mainframe OSs include:
OS,operating system,EXT,"The first microcomputers did not have the capacity or need for the elaborate OSs that had been developed for mainframes and minis; minimalistic OSs were developed, often loaded from ROM and known as monitors."
OS,operating system,EXT,"One notable early disk OS was CP/M, which was supported on many early microcomputers and was closely imitated by Microsoft's MS-DOS, which became widely popular as the OS chosen for the IBM PC ."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The introduction of the Intel 80386 CPU chip in October 1985, with 32-bit architecture and paging capabilities, provided personal computers with the ability to run multitasking OSs like those of earlier minicomputers and mainframes."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Microsoft responded to this progress by hiring Dave Cutler, who had developed the VMS OS for Digital Equipment Corporation."
OS,operating system,EXT,"He would lead the development of the Windows NT OS, which continues to serve as the basis for Microsoft's OSs line."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Apple Inc., started NeXT Computer Inc., which developed the NEXTSTEP OS."
OS,operating system,EXT,The GNU Project was started by activist and programmer Richard Stallman with the goal of creating a complete free software replacement to the proprietary UNIX OS.
OS,operating system,EXT,It was soon merged with the GNU user space components and system software to form a complete OS.
OS,operating system,EXT,Unix and Unix-like OSs =
OS,operating system,EXT,"B was replaced by C, and Unix, rewritten in C, developed into a large, complex family of inter-related OSs which have been influential in every modern OS ."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The Unix-like family is a diverse group of OSs, with several major sub-categories including System V, BSD, and Linux."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The name ""UNIX"" is a trademark of The Open Group which licenses it for use with any OS that has been shown to conform to their definitions. """
OS,operating system,EXT,"UNIX-like"" is commonly used to refer to the large set of OSs which resemble the original UNIX."
OS,operating system,EXT,Four OSs are certified by The Open Group  as Unix.
OS,operating system,EXT,"The POSIX standard can be applied to any OS, although it was originally created for various Unix variants."
OS,operating system,EXT,"These OSs are most commonly found on webservers, although they can also function as a personal computer OS."
OS,operating system,EXT,"macOS   is a line of open core graphical OSs developed, marketed, and sold by Apple Inc., the latest of which is pre-loaded on all currently shipping Macintosh computers."
OS,operating system,EXT,"macOS is the successor to the original classic Mac OS, which had been Apple's primary OS since 1984."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Unlike its predecessor, macOS is a UNIX OS built on technology that had been developed at NeXT through the second half of the 1980s and up until Apple purchased the company in early 1997."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The OS was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0, followed in March 2001 by a client version ."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Microsoft Windows is a family of proprietary OSs designed by Microsoft Corporation and primarily targeted to Intel architecture based computers, with an estimated 88.9 percent total usage share on Web connected computers."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Microsoft Windows was first released in 1985, as an operating environment running on top of MS-DOS, which was the standard OS shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the time."
OS,operating system,EXT,"In recent years, Microsoft has expended significant capital in an effort to promote the use of Windows as a server OS."
OS,operating system,EXT,"ReactOS is a Windows-alternative OS, which is being developed on the principles of Windows –  without using any of Microsoft's code."
OS,operating system,EXT,"There have been many OSs that were significant in their day but are no longer so, such as AmigaOS; OS/2 from IBM and Microsoft; classic Mac OS, the non-Unix precursor to Apple's macOS; BeOS; XTS-300; RISC OS; MorphOS; Haiku; BareMetal and FreeMint."
OS,operating system,EXT,"VMS Software Inc. Yet other OSs are used almost exclusively in academia, for OSs education or to do research on OS concepts."

OS,operating system,EXT,The components of an OS all exist in order to make the different parts of a computer work together.
OS,operating system,EXT,"All user software needs to go through the OS in order to use any of the hardware, whether it be as simple as a mouse or keyboard or as complex as an Internet component."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The OS provides an interface between an application program and the computer hardware, so that an application program can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures programmed into the OS."
OS,operating system,EXT,The OS is also a set of services which simplify development and execution of application programs.
OS,operating system,EXT,"Executing an application program involves the creation of a process by the OS kernel which assigns memory space and other resources, establishes a priority for the process in multi-tasking systems, loads program binary code into memory, and initiates execution of the application program which then interacts with the user and with hardware devices."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Interrupts are central to OSs, as they provide an efficient way for the OS to interact with and react to its environment."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The alternative –  having the OS ""watch"" the various sources of input for events  that require action –  can be found in older systems with very small stacks  but is unusual in modern systems with large stacks."
OS,operating system,EXT,"In modern OSs, interrupts are handled by the OS's kernel."
OS,operating system,EXT,"When a hardware device triggers an interrupt, the OS's kernel decides how to deal with this event, generally by running some processing code."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called a device driver, which may be part of the OS's kernel, part of another program, or both."
OS,operating system,EXT,A program may also trigger an interrupt to the OS.
OS,operating system,EXT,"If a program wishes to access hardware, for example, it may interrupt the OS's kernel, which causes control to be passed back to the kernel."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Once an OS kernel has been loaded and started, the boundary between user mode and supervisor mode  can be established."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Attempts to alter these resources generally causes a switch to supervisor mode, where the OS can deal with the illegal operation the program was attempting, for example, by forcibly terminating "
OS,operating system,EXT,"==== Memory management ====

Among other things, a multiprogramming OS kernel must be responsible for managing all system memory which is currently in use by programs."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Cooperative memory management, used by many early OSs, assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the kernel's memory manager, and do not exceed their allocated memory."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another program's memory, or may affect the operation of the OS itself."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The use of virtual memory addressing  means that the kernel can choose what memory each program may use at any given time, allowing the OS to use the same memory locations for multiple tasks."
OS,operating system,EXT,"In modern OSs, memory which is accessed less frequently can be temporarily stored on disk or other media to make that space available for use by other programs."
OS,operating system,EXT,"An OS kernel contains a scheduling program which determines how much time each process spends executing, and in which order execution control should be passed to programs."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Modern OSs extend the concepts of application preemption to device drivers and kernel code, so that the OS has preemptive control over internal run-times as well."
OS,operating system,EXT,"To accomplish this, modern OS kernels make use of a timed interrupt."
OS,operating system,EXT,"On many single user OSs cooperative multitasking is perfectly adequate, as home computers generally run a small number of well tested programs."
OS,operating system,EXT,Access to data stored on disks is a central feature of all OSs.
OS,operating system,EXT,Early OSs generally supported a single type of disk drive and only one kind of file system.
OS,operating system,EXT,"These limitations often reflected limitations in the OSs they were designed for, making it very difficult for an OS to support more than one file system."
OS,operating system,EXT,"While many simpler OSs support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems, OSs like UNIX and Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS."
OS,operating system,EXT,"An OS such as UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices, regardless of their design or file systems, allowing them to be accessed through a common application programming interface ."
OS,operating system,EXT,"A VFS allows the OS to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them, through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers."
OS,operating system,EXT,The device driver understands the specific language of the drive and is able to translate that language into a standard language used by the OS to access all disk drives.
OS,operating system,EXT,A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the OS can use to talk to all file systems.
OS,operating system,EXT,"However, in practice, third party drivers are usually available to give support for the most widely used file systems in most general-purpose OSs (for example, NTFS is available in Linux through NTFS-3g, and"
OS,operating system,EXT,"Support for file systems is highly varied among modern OSs, although there are several common file systems which almost all OSs include support and drivers for."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Under Windows, each file system is usually limited in application to certain media; for example, CDs must use ISO 9660 or UDF, and as of Windows Vista, NTFS is the only file system which the OS can be installed on."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Unlike other OSs, Linux and UNIX allow any file system to be used regardless of the media it is stored in, whether it is a hard drive, a disc , a USB flash drive, or even contained within a file located on another file system."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device, through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware is connected to, providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device, and on the other end, the requisite interfaces to the OS and software applications."
OS,operating system,EXT,"It is a specialized hardware-dependent computer program which is also OS specific that enables another program, typically an OS or applications software package or computer program running under the OS kernel, to interact transparently with a hardware device, and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interfacing needs."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Computers and their OSs cannot be expected to know how to control every device, both now and in the future."
OS,operating system,EXT,"To solve this problem, OSs essentially dictate how every type of device should be controlled."
OS,operating system,EXT,The function of the device driver is then to translate these OS mandated function calls into device specific calls.
OS,operating system,EXT,This new driver ensures that the device appears to operate as usual from the OS's point of view.
OS,operating system,EXT,"More recent revisions of these OSs incorporate kernel preemption, where the kernel interrupts the driver to give it tasks, and then separates itself from the process until it receives a response from the device driver, or gives it more tasks to do."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Currently most OSs support a variety of networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them."
OS,operating system,EXT,"This means that computers running dissimilar OSs can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections."
OS,operating system,EXT,Networks can essentially allow a computer's OS to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer.
OS,operating system,EXT,"A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the OS kernel."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Many OSs support one or more vendor-specific or open networking protocols as well, for example, SNA on IBM systems, DECnet on systems from Digital Equipment Corporation, and Microsoft-specific protocols  on Windows."
OS,operating system,EXT,"A modern OS provides access to a number of resources, which are available to software running on the system, and to external devices like networks via the kernel."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The OS must be capable of distinguishing between requests which should be allowed to be processed, and others which should not be processed."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Internal security, or security from an already running program is only possible if all possibly harmful requests must be carried out through interrupts to the OS kernel."
OS,operating system,EXT,"External requests are often passed through device drivers to the OS's kernel, where they can be passed onto applications, or carried out directly."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Security of OSs has long been a concern because of highly sensitive data held on computers, both of a commercial and military nature."
OS,operating system,EXT,"This became of vital importance to OS makers, because the TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify and select trusted OSs being considered for the processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive or classified information."
OS,operating system,EXT,"At the OS level, there are a number of software firewalls available, as well as intrusion detection/prevention systems."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Most modern OSs include a software firewall, which is enabled by default."
OS,operating system,EXT,A software firewall can be configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the OS.
OS,operating system,EXT,"An alternative strategy, and the only sandbox strategy available in systems that do not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements, is where the OS is not running user programs as native code, but instead either emulates a processor or provides a host for a p-code based system such as Java."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Internal security is also vital if auditing is to be of any use, since a program can potentially bypass the OS, inclusive of bypassing auditing."
OS,operating system,EXT,"The user interface views the directory structure and requests services from the OS that will acquire data from input hardware devices, such as a keyboard, mouse or credit card reader, and requests OS services to display prompts, status messages and such on output hardware devices, such as a video monitor or printer."
OS,operating system,EXT,"While technically a graphical user interface is not an OS service, incorporating support for one into the OS kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Other OSs are modular, separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System."
OS,operating system,EXT,"In the 1980s UNIX, VMS and many others had OSs that were built this way."
OS,operating system,EXT,Many computer OSs allow the user to install or create any user interface they desire.
OS,operating system,EXT,Real-time OSs ==
OS,operating system,EXT,A real-time OS  is an OS intended for applications with fixed deadlines .
OS,operating system,EXT,An early example of a large-scale real-time OS was Transaction Processing Facility developed by American Airlines and IBM for the Sabre Airline Reservations System.
OS,operating system,EXT,"Embedded systems that have fixed deadlines use a real-time OS such as VxWorks, PikeOS, eCos, QNX, MontaVista Linux and RTLinux."
OS,operating system,EXT,Windows CE is a real-time OS that shares similar APIs to desktop Windows but shares none of desktop Windows' codebase.
OS,operating system,EXT,"Some embedded systems use OSs such as Palm OS, BSD, and Linux, although such OSs do not support real-time computing."
OS,operating system,EXT,"A hobby OS may be classified as one whose code has not been directly derived from an existing OS, and has few users and active developers."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Operating system development may come from entirely new concepts, or may commence by modeling an existing OS."
OS,operating system,EXT,Examples of a hobby OS include Syllable and TempleOS.
OS,operating system,EXT,Diversity of OSs and portability ==
OS,operating system,EXT,"Application software is generally written for use on a specific OS, and sometimes even for specific hardware."
OS,operating system,EXT,"Unix was the first OS not written in assembly language, making it very portable to systems different from its native PDP-11.This cost in supporting OSs diversity can be avoided by instead writing applications against software platforms such as Java or Qt."
OS,operating system,EXT,These abstractions have already borne the cost of adaptation to specific OSs and their system libraries.
OS,operating system,EXT,Another approach is for OS vendors to adopt standards.

HN,heterogeneous network,EXT,"For example, a wireless network that provides a service through a wireless LAN and is able to maintain the service when switching to a cellular network is called a wireless HN."
HN,heterogeneous network,EXT,"Therefore, using the term ""HN"" without putting it into context can result in a source of confusion in scientific literature and during the peer-review cycle."
PI,prediction intervals,EXT,"Prediction intervals are used in both frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics: a prediction interval bears the same relationship to a future observation that a frequentist confidence interval or Bayesian credible interval bears to an unobservable population parameter: PI predict the distribution of individual future points, whereas confidence intervals and credible intervals of parameters predict the distribution of estimates of the true population mean or other quantity of interest that cannot be observed."
PI,prediction intervals,EXT,"For example, if one makes the parametric assumption that the underlying distribution is a normal distribution, and has a sample set {X1, ..., Xn}, then confidence intervals and credible intervals may be used to estimate the population mean μ and population standard deviation σ of the underlying population, while PI may be used to estimate the value of the next sample variable, Xn+1."
PI,prediction intervals,EXT,The concept of PI need not be restricted to inference about a single future sample value but can be extended to more complicated cases.
PI,prediction intervals,EXT,"Since PI are only concerned with past and future observations, rather than unobservable population parameters, they are advocated as a better method than confidence intervals by some statisticians, such as Seymour Geisser, following the focus on observables by Bruno de Finetti.


=="
PI,prediction intervals,EXT,"Given a sample from a normal distribution, whose parameters are unknown, it is possible to give PI in the frequentist sense, i.e., an interval  based on statistics of the sample such that on repeated experiments, Xn+1 falls in the interval the desired percentage of the time; one may call these ""predictive confidence intervals""."
PI,prediction intervals,EXT,"A general technique of frequentist PI is to find and compute a pivotal quantity of the observables X1, ..., Xn, Xn+1 – meaning a function of observables and parameters whose probability distribution does not depend on the parameters – that can be inverted to give a probability of the future observation Xn+1 falling in some interval computed in terms of the observed values so far,"
PI,prediction intervals,EXT,"One can compute PI without any assumptions on the population; formally, this is a non-parametric method."
PI,prediction intervals,EXT,A common application of PI is to regression analysis.
PI,prediction intervals,EXT,"In Bayesian statistics, one can compute  PI from the posterior probability of the random variable, as a credible interval."

PI,power iteration,EXT,"Although the PI method approximates only one eigenvalue of a matrix, it remains useful for certain computational problems."
PI,power iteration,EXT,"The PI method is especially suitable for sparse matrices, such as the web matrix, or as the matrix-free method that does not require storing the coefficient matrix"
PI,power iteration,EXT,For non-symmetric matrices that are well-conditioned the PI method can outperform more complex Arnoldi iteration.
PI,power iteration,EXT,"For symmetric matrices, the PI method is rarely used, since its convergence speed can be easily increased without sacrificing the small cost per iteration; see, e.g., Lanczos iteration and LOBPCG."
PI,power iteration,EXT,Some of the more advanced eigenvalue algorithms can be understood as variations of the PI.

SO,smart object,EXT,A SO is an object that enhances the interaction with not only people but also with other SOs.
SO,smart object,EXT,"The concept of a SO has several origins and uses, see History."
SO,smart object,EXT,The SO concept was introduced by Marcelo Kallman and Daniel Thalmann as an object that can describe its own possible interactions.
SO,smart object,EXT,The opposite approach to SOs is 'plain' objects that do not provide this information.
SO,smart object,EXT,"Here,  ""SOs"" are described as ""objects connected to the Net; objects that can sense their users and display smart behaviour""."

SO,smart object,EXT,"Poslad considers the progression of: how

humans use models of SOs situated in the physical world to enhance human to physical world interaction; versus how
smart physical objects situated in the physical world can model human interaction in order to lessen the need for human to physical world interaction; versus how

SMP,stable marriage problem,EXT,"In mathematics, economics, and computer science, the SMP  is the problem of finding a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences for each element."
SMP,stable marriage problem,EXT,The SMP has been stated as follows:
SMP,stable marriage problem,EXT,"Algorithms for finding solutions to the SMP have applications in a variety of real-world situations, perhaps the best known of these being in the assignment of graduating medical students to their first hospital appointments."
SMP,stable marriage problem,EXT,"Content delivery networks that distribute much of the world's content and services solve this large and complex SMP between users and servers every tens of seconds to enable billions of users to be matched up with their respective servers that can provide the requested web pages, videos, or other services."
SMP,stable marriage problem,EXT,"In general, the family of solutions to any instance of the SMP can be given the structure of a finite distributive lattice,
and this structure leads to efficient algorithms for several problems on stable marriages."
SMP,stable marriage problem,EXT,"In a uniformly-random instance of the SMP with n men and n women, the average number of stable matchings is asymptotically"
SMP,stable marriage problem,EXT,"The Rural hospitals theorem concerns a more general variant of the stable matching problem, like that applying in the problem of matching doctors to positions at hospitals, differing in the following ways from the basic n-to-n form of the SMP:

SR,systematic review,EXT,"A SR, or systematic literature review, is a type of literature review that uses systematic methods to collect secondary data, critically appraise research studies, and synthesize findings qualitatively or quantitatively."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Systematic reviews formulate research questions that are broad or narrow in scope, and identify and synthesize studies that directly relate to the SR question."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"understanding of SRs and how to implement them in practice is highly recommended for professionals involved in the delivery of health care, public health, and public policy."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Contrastingly, SRs of observational studies rank lower in the evidence-based hierarchy."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"However, another important factor that impacts the quality of the evidence is the accuracy of the methodological design and execution of the SR carried out by the authors."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"While SRs are often applied in the biomedical or healthcare context, they can be used in other areas where an assessment of a precisely defined subject would be helpful."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"For example, SRs are becoming increasingly common in management, accounting and finance."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"A SR aims to provide a complete, exhaustive summary of current literature relevant to a research question."
SR,systematic review,EXT,The first step in conducting a SR is to create a structured question to guide the review.
SR,systematic review,EXT,"The Methodology section of a SR will list all of the databases and citation indexes that were searched such as Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed and any individual journals that were searched."
SR,systematic review,EXT,Groups like the Campbell Collaboration are promoting the use of SRs in policy-making beyond just healthcare.
SR,systematic review,EXT,"A SR uses an objective and transparent approach for research synthesis, with the aim of minimizing bias."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"While many SRs are based on an explicit quantitative meta-analysis of available data, there are also qualitative reviews which adhere to standards for gathering, analyzing and reporting evidence."
SR,systematic review,EXT,The EPPI-Centre has been influential in developing methods for combining both qualitative and quantitative research in SRs.
SR,systematic review,EXT,"The PRISMA statement suggests a standardized way to ensure a transparent and complete reporting of SRs, and is now required for this kind of research by more than 170 medical journals worldwide."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Developments in SRs during the 21st century included realist reviews and the meta-narrative approach, both of which addressed problems of methods and heterogeneity existing on some subjects."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Scoping reviews ===
Scoping reviews are distinct from SRs in a number of important ways."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"A scoping review may often be a preliminary stage before a SR, which 'scopes' out an area of inquiry and maps the language and key concepts."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"As it is a kind of review which should be systematically conducted , some academic publishers categorize them as a kind of 'SR', which may cause confusion."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Scoping reviews are a helpful method when an area of inquiry is very broad, for example, exploring how the public are involved in all stages SRs."
SR,systematic review,EXT,The main stages of a SR are:
SR,systematic review,EXT,It is considered best practice to publish the protocol of the SR before initiating it in order to help avoid unplanned duplication and to enable comparison of reported review methods with what was planned in the protocol.
SR,systematic review,EXT,Contacting a trained information professional or librarian can improve the quality of the SR.
SR,systematic review,EXT,Living SRs ===
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Living SRs are a relatively new kind of high quality, semi-automated, up-to-date online summaries of research which are updated as new research becomes available."
SR,systematic review,EXT,The essential difference between 'living SR' and conventional SR is the publication format.
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Living SRs are 'dynamic, persistent, online-only evidence summaries, which are updated rapidly and frequently'."
SR,systematic review,EXT,This is the first which can be said as SR.
SR,systematic review,EXT,Methodology reviews address issues relevant to how SRs and clinical trials are conducted and reported.
SR,systematic review,EXT,Overviews of SRs  are a new type of study in order to compile multiple evidence from SRs into a single document that is accessible and useful to serve as a friendly front end for the Cochrane Collaboration with regard to healthcare decision-making.
SR,systematic review,EXT,"The Cochrane Collaboration provides a handbook for SRers of interventions which ""provides guidance to authors for the preparation of Cochrane Intervention reviews."""
SR,systematic review,EXT,"The Cochrane Handbook outlines eight general steps for preparing a SR:
Defining the review question and developing criteria for including studies
Searching for studies
Selecting studies and collecting data"
SR,systematic review,EXT,"It is the collection of Cochrane Reviews, a database of SRs and meta-analyses which summarize and interpret the results of medical research."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"The quasi-standard for SR in the social sciences is based on the procedures proposed by the Campbell Collaboration, which is one of a number of groups promoting evidence-based policy in the social sciences."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"The Campbell Collaboration ""helps people make well-informed decisions by preparing, maintaining and disseminating SRs in education, crime and justice, social welfare and international development."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"In 1959, social scientist and social work educator Barbara Wootton published one of the first contemporary SRs of literature on anti-social behavior as part of her work, Social Science and Social Pathology."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"While SRs are regarded as the strongest form of medical evidence, a review of 300 studies found that not all SRs were equally reliable, and that their reporting can be improved by a universally agreed upon set of standards and guidelines."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"A further study by the same group found that of 100 SRs monitored, 7% needed updating at the time of publication, another 4% within a year, and another 11% within 2 years; this figure was higher in rapidly changing fields of medicine, especially cardiovascular medicine."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Roberts and colleagues highlighted the problems with SRs, particularly those conducted by the Cochrane, noting that published reviews are often biased, out of date and excessively long."
SR,systematic review,EXT,Another concern is that the methods used to conduct a SR are sometimes changed once researchers see the available trials they are going to include.
SR,systematic review,EXT,Bloggers have described retractions of SRs and published reports of studies included in published SRs.
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Subsequently, a number of donors – most notably the UK Department for International Development  and AusAid – are focusing more attention and resources on testing the appropriateness of SRs in assessing the impacts of development and humanitarian interventions."
SR,systematic review,EXT,"This lack of reporting has extremely serious implications for research, including SRs, as it is only possible to synthesize data of published trials."
SR,systematic review,EXT,A recent SR of industry sponsorship and research outcomes concluded that 'sponsorship of drug and device studies by the manufacturing company leads to more favorable efficacy results and conclusions than sponsorship by other sources' and that the existence of an industry bias that cannot be explained by standard 'Risk of bias' assessments.
SR,systematic review,EXT,"Systematic reviews of such a bias may amplify the effect, although the flaw is in the reporting of research, not in the SR process."

CPI,consumer price index,EXT,"The way in which owner-occupied dwellings should be dealt with in a CPI has been, and remains, a subject of heated controversy in many countries."
CPI,consumer price index,EXT,"This cost, according to many economists, is what should form a component of a CPI."
CPI,consumer price index,EXT,"This means that if the movement of incomes is to be compared with the movement of the CPI, incomes must be expressed as money income plus this imaginary consumption value."
CPI,consumer price index,EXT,"Everyone agrees that repairs and maintenance expenditure of owner-occupied dwellings should be covered in a CPI, but the spending approach would include mortgage interest too."

CPI,consumer price index,EXT,A CPI compares how much it would cost now to do exactly what consumers did in the reference-period with what it cost then.
CPI,consumer price index,EXT,"The application of this principle in the owner-occupied dwellings component of a CPI is known as the ""debt profile"" method."
CPI,consumer price index,EXT,"Another is to correct nominal mortgage rates for changes in dwelling prices or for changes in the rest of the CPI to obtain a ""real"" rate of interest."
CPI,consumer price index,EXT,"For example, it may be thought to help understanding and facilitate economic analysis if what is included under the heading of 'consumption' is the same in the CPI and in the national income and expenditure accounts."

RV,right ventricle,EXT,"In a four-chambered heart, such as that in humans, there are two ventricles that operate in a double circulatory system: the RV pumps blood into the pulmonary circulation to the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps blood into the systemic circulation through the aorta."
RV,right ventricle,EXT,"Further, the left ventricle has thicker walls than the right because it needs to pump blood to most of the body while the RV fills only the lungs."
RV,right ventricle,EXT,"On the inner walls of the ventricles are irregular muscular columns called trabeculae carneae which cover all of the inner ventricular surfaces except that of the conus arteriosus, in the RV."
RV,right ventricle,EXT,The RV is equal in size to the left ventricle and contains roughly 85 millilitres  in the adult.
RV,right ventricle,EXT,"Its posterior wall is formed by the ventricular septum, which bulges into the RV, so that a transverse section of the cavity presents a semilunar outline."
RV,right ventricle,EXT,The left ventricle is thicker and more muscular than the RV because it pumps blood at a higher pressure.
RV,right ventricle,EXT,The RV is triangular in shape and extends from the tricuspid valve in the right atrium to near the apex of the heart.
RV,right ventricle,EXT,"By early maturity, the walls of the left ventricle have thickened from three to six times greater than that of the RV."

RV,random variable,EXT,Another RV may be the person's number of children; this is a discrete RV with  non-negative integer values.
RV,random variable,EXT,"In examples such as these, the sample space is often suppressed, since it is mathematically hard to describe, and the possible values of the RVs are then treated as a sample space."

AV,antivirus,EXT,"However, with the proliferation of other kinds of malware, AV software started to provide protection from other computer threats."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In particular, modern AV software can protect users from: malicious browser helper objects , browser hijackers, ransomware, keyloggers, backdoors, rootkits, trojan horses, worms, malicious LSPs, dialers, fraudtools, adware and spyware."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Some people consider ""The Reaper"" the first AV software ever written – it may be the case, but it is important to note that the Reaper was actually a virus itself specifically designed to remove the Creeper virus."
AV,antivirus,EXT,There are competing claims for the innovator of the first AV product.
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Possibly, the first publicly documented removal of an ""in the wild"" computer virus  was performed by Bernd Fix in 1987.In 1987, Andreas Lüning and Kai Figge, who founded G Data Software in 1985, released their first AV product for the Atari ST platform."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Also in 1987 , Peter Paško, Rudolf Hrubý, and Miroslav Trnka created the first version of NOD AV."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Finally, at the end of 1987, the first two heuristic AV utilities were released:"
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In 1988, the growth of AV companies continued."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In Bulgaria, Vesselin Bontchev released his first freeware AV program ."

AV,antivirus,EXT,"In June 1988, in South Korea, Ahn Cheol-Soo released its first AV software, called V1 ."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In November 1988 a professor at the Panamerican University in Mexico City named Alejandro E. Carriles copyrighted the first AV software in Mexico under the name ""Byte Matabichos""  to help solve the rampant virus infestation among students."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In the meanwhile, in United States, Symantec  launched its first Symantec AV for Macintosh ."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In the end of the 1980s, in United Kingdom, Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer founded the security firm Sophos and began producing their first AV and encryption products."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In Hungary, the security researcher Péter Szőr released the first version of Pasteur AV."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In Italy, Gianfranco Tonello created the first version of VirIT eXplorer AV, then founded TG Soft one year later."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"On the other hand, in Finland, F-Secure  released the first version of their AV product."
AV,antivirus,EXT,F-Secure claims to be the first AV firm to establish a presence on the World Wide Web.
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In 1991, the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research  was founded to further AV research and improve development of AV software."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In 2000, Rainer Link and Howard Fuhs started the first open source AV engine, called OpenAntivirus Project."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In 2001, Tomasz Kojm released the first version of ClamAV, the first ever open source AV engine to be commercialised."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In 2007, ClamAV was bought by Sourcefire, which in turn was acquired by Cisco Systems in 2013.In 2002, in United Kingdom, Morten Lund and Theis Søndergaard co-founded the AV firm BullGuard."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In 2012 and 2013, AV firms reported a new malware samples range from 300,000 to over 500,000 per day."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Over the years it has become necessary for AV software to use several different strategies  and detection algorithms, as well as to check an increasing variety of files, rather than just executables, for several reasons:"
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Because most users are usually connected to the Internet on a continual basis, Jon Oberheide first proposed a Cloud-based AV design in 2008.In February 2008"
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Increasingly, these signature-less approaches have been defined by the media and analyst firms as ""next-generation"" AV and are seeing rapid market adoption as certified AV replacement technologies by firms such as Coalfire and DirectDefense."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"In response, traditional AV vendors such as Trend Micro, Symantec and Sophos have responded by incorporating ""next-gen"" offerings into their portfolios as analyst firms such as Forrester and Gartner have called traditional signature-based AV ""ineffective"" and ""outdated""."
AV,antivirus,EXT,There are several methods which AV engine can use to identify malware:
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Depending on the actions logged, the AV engine can determine if the program is malicious or not."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Albeit this technique has shown to be quite effective, given its heaviness and slowness, it is rarely used in end-user AV solutions."
AV,antivirus,EXT,Traditional AV software relies heavily upon signatures to identify malware.
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Substantially, when a malware arrives in the hands of an AV firm, it is analysed by malware researchers or by dynamic analysis systems."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Then, once it is determined to be a malware, a proper signature of the file is extracted and added to the signatures database of the AV software."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"For example, the Vundo trojan has several family members, depending on the AV vendor's classification."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Real-time protection, on-access scanning, background guard, resident shield, autoprotect, and other synonyms refer to the automatic protection provided by most AV, anti-spyware, and other anti-malware programs."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Some commercial AV software end-user license agreements include a clause that the subscription will be automatically renewed, and the purchaser's credit card automatically billed, at the renewal time without explicit approval."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Some apparent AV programs are actually malware masquerading as legitimate software, such as WinFixer, MS Antivirus, and Mac Defender."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"A ""false positive"" or ""false alarm"" is when AV software identifies a non-malicious file as malware."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"For example, if an AV program is configured to immediately delete or quarantine infected files, as is common on Microsoft Windows AV applications, a false positive in an essential file can render the Windows operating system or some applications unusable."
AV,antivirus,EXT,Running  multiple AV programs concurrently can degrade performance and create conflicts.
AV,antivirus,EXT,Active AV protection may partially or completely prevent the installation of a major update.
AV,antivirus,EXT,Support issues also exist around AV application interoperability with common solutions like SSL VPN remote access and network access control products.
AV,antivirus,EXT,These technology solutions often have policy assessment applications that require an up-to-date AV to be installed and running.
AV,antivirus,EXT,"If the AV application is not recognized by the policy assessment, whether because the AV application has been updated or because it is not part of the policy assessment library, the user will be unable to connect."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Studies in December 2007 showed that the effectiveness of AV software had decreased in the previous year, particularly against unknown or zero day attacks."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"At that time, the only exception was the NOD32 AV, which managed a detection rate of 68%."
AV,antivirus,EXT,and it gets by well-known AV products very easily.
AV,antivirus,EXT,yet they have AV software running
AV,antivirus,EXT,Rootkits can modify the inner workings of the operating system and tamper with AV programs.
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Furthermore, inexperienced users can be lulled into a false sense of security when using the computer, considering their computers to be invulnerable, and may have problems understanding the prompts and decisions that AV software presents them with."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"If the AV software employs heuristic detection, it must be fine-tuned to minimize misidentifying harmless software as"
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Other solutions can also be employed by users, including Unified Threat Management , hardware and network firewalls, Cloud-based AV and online scanners."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"However, they are not AV systems and make no attempt to identify or remove anything."
AV,antivirus,EXT,Cloud AV =
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Cloud AV is a technology that uses lightweight agent software on the protected computer, while offloading the majority of data analysis to the provider's infrastructure."
AV,antivirus,EXT,One approach to implementing cloud AV involves scanning suspicious files using multiple AV engines.
AV,antivirus,EXT,This approach was proposed by an early implementation of the cloud AV concept called CloudAV.
AV,antivirus,EXT,CloudAV was designed to send programs or documents to a network cloud where multiple AV and behavioral detection programs are used simultaneously in order to improve detection rates.
AV,antivirus,EXT,Parallel scanning of files using potentially incompatible AV scanners is achieved by spawning a virtual machine per detection engine and therefore eliminating any possible issues.
AV,antivirus,EXT,"Some AV vendors maintain websites with free online scanning capability of the entire computer, critical areas only, local disks, folders or files."
AV,antivirus,EXT,Periodic online scanning is a good idea for those that run AV applications on their computers because those applications are frequently slow to catch threats.
AV,antivirus,EXT,One of the first things that malicious software does in an attack is disable any existing AV software and sometimes the only way to know of an attack is by turning to an online resource that is not installed on the infected computer.
AV,antivirus,EXT,"It is also worth noting that sometimes AV software can produce a false positive result, indicating an infection where there is none."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"A rescue disk that is bootable, such as a CD or USB storage device, can be used to run AV software outside of the installed operating system, in order to remove infections while they are dormant."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"A bootable AV disk can be useful when, for example, the installed operating system is no longer bootable or has malware that is resisting all attempts to be removed by the installed AV software."
AV,antivirus,EXT,"A survey by Symantec in 2009 found that a third of small to medium-sized business did not use AV protection at that time, whereas more than 80% of home users had some kind of AV installed."
AV,antivirus,EXT,According to a sociological survey conducted by G Data Software in 2010 49% of women did not use any AV program at all.
AV,antivirus,EXT,Comparison of AV software
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"A self-driving car, also known as an AV , connected and AV , full self-driving car or driverless car, or robo-car or robotic car,  is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Due to these characteristics, AVs are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,This concept of homogenization also applies to AVs.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"In order for AVs to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information ."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT," which also supports the AVs to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the marginal costs."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"In the case of AVs, it is essential for them to connect with other 'devices' in order to function most effectively."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other AVs and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual AV as it navigates through an intersection."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of AVs to understand and cooperate with other products and services  in the AVs market.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,This could lead to a network of AVs all using the same network and information available on that network.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Eventually, this can lead to more AVs using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other AVs."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Another characteristic of AVs is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"This is because AVs have software systems that drive the vehicle, meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner ."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of AVs is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through machine learning, smart AVs can generate certain updates and install them accordingly ."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of AVs the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,This also implies that AVs are never finished because the product can continuously be improved.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other AVs and/or roadside units."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,This implies that AVs leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new  products or updates to enhance AVs' driving ability or safety.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Traditional vehicles and their accompanying technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike AVs, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"As said, AVs are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,This is because AVs are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the AVs which enable the transmission of digital information."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Next to that, the network layer of AVs also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,This increases the accessibility of the AVs and enables the computational power of a network or platform.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the AV  as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and
"
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"The AVs store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,2010).The consequence of layered modular architecture of AVs  is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of AVs.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"The potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability, the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated, and thus a long period of humans and AVs sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to forfeiting control of their cars, concerns about safety, and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of AVs, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"While most trolley conundrums involve hyperbolic and unlikely fact patterns, it is inevitable mundane ethical decisions and risk calculations such as the precise millisecond a car should yield to a yellow light or how closely to drive to a bike lane will need to be programmed into the software of AVs."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"People overwhelmingly express a preference for AVs to be programmed with utilitarian ideas, that is, in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,conclude that the regulation of AV ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"At the end of 2018, Yandex obtained a license to operate AVs on public roads in Nevada, USA."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"For example, the entrance of tech giants, as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of AVs."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"With the increasing reliance of AVs on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real-time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,Numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on US roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated US$500 billion loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when AVs are dominating the roads.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"It is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of AVs, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,An unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of AVs would be a reduction in the supply of organs for donation.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"The elderly and persons with disabilities  are potential beneficiaries of adoption of AVs; however, the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to AVs will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Since many AVs are going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"As this implication depends on the adoption rate of AVs, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"With the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of AVs, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Meanwhile, as the generated data of the AV is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"The implementation of AVs with rescue, emergency response, and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Military personnel use AVs to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies and even rescue people."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"In addition, a future implication of adopting AVs could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows AVs to become more and more autonomous."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,Another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when AVs are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"With the driver decreasingly focused on operating a vehicle, the interior design and media-entertainment industry will have to reconsider what passengers of AVs are doing when they are on the road."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the AV will have a double function."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"Moreover, accompanied by the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the AV industry might cause another implication for their customer bases."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since AVs could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"In a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully AV, while  Daimler is predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand AV."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"A new standardised questionnaire, the AV acceptance model  was developed, including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of different automation levels."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly AVs.
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"The term ""AV"" excludes a motor vehicle enabled with active safety systems or driver- assistance systems, including systems to provide electronic blind-spot assistance, crash avoidance, emergency braking, parking assistance, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assistance, lane-departure warning, or traffic-jam and queuing assistance, unless the system alone or in combination with other systems enables the vehicle on which the technology is installed to drive without active control or monitoring by a human operator."
AV,autonomous vehicle,EXT,"In the same district code, it is considered that:

An AV may operate on a public roadway; provided, that the vehicle:
 Has a manual override feature that allows a driver to assume control of the AV at any time;
 Has a driver seated in the control seat of the vehicle while in operation who is prepared to take control of the AV at any moment; and
 Is capable of operating in compliance with the District's applicable traffic laws and motor vehicle laws and traffic control devices."

BP,backprop,EXT,"In fitting a neural network, BPagation computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example, and does so efficiently, unlike a naive direct computation of the gradient with respect to each weight individually."
BP,backprop,EXT,"The BPagation algorithm works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this is an example of dynamic programming."

BP,backprop,EXT,"For BPagation, the loss function calculates the difference between the network output and its expected output, after a training example has propagated through the network."
BP,backprop,EXT,The mathematical expression of the loss function must fulfill two conditions in order for it to be possibly used in BPagation.
BP,backprop,EXT,"The reason for this assumption is that the BPagation algorithm calculates the gradient of the error function for a single training example, which needs to be generalized to the overall error function."
BP,backprop,EXT,"Gradient descent with BPagation is not guaranteed to find the global minimum of the error function, but only a local minimum; also, it has trouble crossing plateaus in the error function landscape."
BP,backprop,EXT,"The term BPagation and its general use in neural networks was announced in Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams , then elaborated and popularized in Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams , but the technique was independently rediscovered many times, and had many predecessors dating to the 1960s."
BP,backprop,EXT,"The basics of continuous BPagation were derived in the context of control theory by Henry J. Kelley in 1960, and by Arthur E. Bryson in 1961."

MSA,multiple sequence alignment,EXT,"A MSA  is a sequence alignment of three or more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA."
MSA,multiple sequence alignment,EXT,Most MSA programs use heuristic methods rather than global optimization because identifying the optimal alignment between more than a few sequences of moderate length is prohibitively computationally expensive.
MSA,multiple sequence alignment,EXT,Therefore it makes sense to construct an algorithm to assist in repetitive calculations of MSAs.
MSA,multiple sequence alignment,EXT,A MSA is taken of this set of sequences
MSA,multiple sequence alignment,EXT,A general approach when calculating MSAs is to use graphs to identify all of the different alignments.
MSA,multiple sequence alignment,EXT,The MSA program optimizes the sum of all of the pairs of characters at each position in the alignment  and has been implemented in a software program for constructing MSAs.
MSA,multiple sequence alignment,EXT,The most widely used approach to MSAs uses a heuristic search known as progressive technique  developed by Da-Fei Feng and Doolittle in 1987.
MSA,multiple sequence alignment,EXT,Consensus methods attempt to find the optimal MSA given multiple different alignments of the same set of sequences.

ECC,elliptic curve cryptography,EXT,"The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology  has endorsed ECC in its Suite B set of recommended algorithms, specifically elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman  for key exchange and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm  for digital signature."
ECC,elliptic curve cryptography,EXT,"The primary benefit promised by ECC is a smaller key size, reducing storage and transmission requirements, i.e. that an elliptic curve group could provide the same level of security afforded by an RSA-based system with a large modulus and correspondingly larger key: for example, a 256-bit elliptic curve public key should provide comparable security to a 3072-bit RSA public key."
ECC,elliptic curve cryptography,EXT,Shor's algorithm can be used to break ECC by computing discrete logarithms on a hypothetical quantum computer.

SL,separation logic,EXT,"O'Hearn's proof rules adapted an early approach of Tony Hoare to reasoning about concurrency,
replacing the use of scoping constraints to ensure separation by reasoning in SL."
SL,separation logic,EXT,"In addition to extending Hoare's approach to apply in the presence of heap-allocated pointers, O'Hearn showed how reasoning in concurrent SL could track dynamic ownership transfer of heap portions between processes; examples in the paper include a pointer-transferring buffer, and a memory manager."
SL,separation logic,EXT,A model for concurrent SL was first provided by Stephen Brookes in a companion paper to O'Hearn's.
SL,separation logic,EXT,"An abstract version of SL was proposed that works for Hoare triples
where the preconditions and postconditions are formulae interpreted over an arbitrary partial commutative monoid instead of a particular heap model."
SL,separation logic,EXT,"Later, by suitable choice of commutative monoid, it was surprisingly found that the proof rules of abstract versions of concurrent SL could be used to reason about interfering concurrent processes, for example by encoding the rely-guarantee technique which had been originally proposed to reason about interference; in this work the elements of the model were considered not resources, but rather ""views"" of the program state, and a non-standard interpretation of Hoare triples accompanies the non-standard reading of pre and postconditions."

SL,supervised learning,EXT,A key aspect of many SL methods is that they are able to adjust this tradeoff between bias and variance .
SL,supervised learning,EXT,"This is an instance of the more general strategy of dimensionality reduction, which seeks to map the input data into a lower-dimensional space prior to running the SL algorithm."
SL,supervised learning,EXT,"In practice, there are several approaches to alleviate noise in the output values such as early stopping to prevent overfitting as well as detecting and removing the noisy training examples prior to training the SL algorithm."
SL,supervised learning,EXT,How SL algorithms work ==

PN,partial nephrectomy,EXT,"A PN should be attempted when there is a kidney tumor in a solitary kidney, when there are kidney tumors in both kidneys, or when removing the entire kidney could result in kidney failure and the need for dialysis."

PN,partial nephrectomy,EXT,Patients who are told their tumors are too big or too hard for a PN may want to seek another opinion because surgeons who take care of many patients with kidney cancer are more often able to spare the kidney than those who only see a few cases.

PA,physical access,EXT,"According to Gregory White, ""Given PA to an office, the knowledgeable attacker will quickly be able to find the information needed to gain access to the organization's computer systems and network."
PA,physical access,EXT,"IT security standards in the United States typically call for PA to be limited by locked server rooms, sign-in sheets, etc."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"A PA process is any of a class of processes in which some quantity, typically some form of wealth or credit, is distributed among a number of individuals or objects according to how much they already have, so that those who are already wealthy receive more than those who are not."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"The principal reason for scientific interest in PA is that it can, under suitable circumstances, generate power law distributions."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"A PA process is a stochastic urn process, meaning a process in which discrete units of wealth, usually called ""balls"", are added in a random or partly random fashion to a set of objects or containers, usually called ""urns""."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,A PA process is an urn process in which additional balls are added continuously to the system and are distributed among the urns as an increasing function of the number of balls the urns already have.
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"In the most commonly studied examples, the number of urns also increases continuously, although this is not a necessary condition for PA and examples have been studied with constant or even decreasing numbers of urns."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,A classic example of a PA process is the growth in the number of species per genus in some higher taxon of biotic organisms.
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"This process, first studied by Yule, is a linear PA process, since the rate at which genera accrue new species is linear in the number they already have."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,Linear PA processes in which the number of urns increases are known to produce a distribution of balls over the urns following the so-called Yule distribution.
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"In other words, the PA process generates a ""long-tailed"" distribution following a Pareto distribution or power law in its tail."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,This is the primary reason for the historical interest in PA:
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,the species distribution and many other phenomena are observed empirically to follow power laws and the PA process is a leading candidate mechanism to explain this behavior.
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,The PA process does not incorporate the taking away part.
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,Qualitatively it is intended to describe not a mechanical multiplicative effect like PA but a specific human behavior in which people are more likely to give credit to the famous than to the little known.
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,the Matthew effect is intended to describe is quite distinct from  PA.
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"The first rigorous consideration of PA seems to be that of Udny Yule in 1925, who used it to explain the power-law distribution of the number of species per genus of flowering plants."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"Most modern treatments of PA make use of the master equation method, whose use in this context was pioneered by Simon in 1955, in work on the distribution of sizes of cities and other phenomena."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,The first application of PA to learned citations was given by Price in 1976.
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"Price also promoted PA as a possible explanation for power laws in many other phenomena, including Lotka's law of scientific productivity and Bradford's law of journal use."
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,The application of PA to the growth of the World Wide Web was proposed by Barabási and Albert in 1999.
PA,preferential attachment,EXT,"Barabási and Albert also coined the name ""PA"" by which the process is best known today and suggested that the process might apply to the growth of other networks as well."

FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"In mathematics, more specifically in fractal geometry, a FD is a ratio providing a statistical index of complexity comparing how detail in a pattern "
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,It has also been characterized as a measure of the space-filling capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently from the space it is embedded in; a FD does not have to be an integer.
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"In terms of that notion, the FD of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,There are several formal mathematical definitions of FD that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale.
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"Ultimately, the term FD became the phrase with which Mandelbrot himself became most comfortable with respect to encapsulating the meaning of the word fractal, a term he created."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"After several iterations over years, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language:  ""...to use fractal without a pedantic definition, to use FD as a generic term applicable to all the variants."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"""One non-trivial example is the FD of a Koch snowflake."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"The FD of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"Therefore its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its FD, which is often a number between one and two; in the case of the Koch snowflake, it is about 1.262."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,A FD is an index for characterizing fractal patterns or sets by quantifying their complexity as a ratio of the change in detail to the change in scale.
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,Several types of FD can be measured theoretically and empirically .
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"The essential idea of fractional or FDs has a long history in mathematics that can be traced back to the 1600s, but the terms fractal and FD were coined by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975.Fractal dimensions were first applied as an index characterizing complicated geometric forms for which the details seemed more important than the gross picture."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"For sets describing ordinary geometric shapes, the theoretical FD equals the set's familiar Euclidean or topological dimension."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"If the theoretical FD of a set exceeds its topological dimension, the set is considered to have fractal geometry."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"For instance, a curve with a FD very near to 1, say 1.10, behaves quite like an ordinary line, but a curve with FD 1.9 winds convolutedly through space very nearly like a surface."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"Similarly, a surface with FD of 2.1 fills space very much like an ordinary surface, but one with a FD of 2.9 folds and flows to fill space rather nearly like a volume."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"2, convoluted and space filling, has a FD of 1.67, compared to the perceptibly less complex Koch curve in Fig."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"3, which has a FD of 1.26."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"The relationship of an increasing FD with space-filling might be taken to mean FDs measure density, but that is not so; the two are not strictly correlated."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"Instead, a FD measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: self-similarity and detail or irregularity."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"However, their FDs can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,Fractal complexity may not always be resolvable into easily grasped units of detail and scale without complex analytic methods but it is still quantifiable through FDs.
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"The terms FD and fractal were coined by Mandelbrot in 1975, about a decade after he published his paper on self-similarity in the coastline of Britain."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"The earliest roots of what Mandelbrot synthesized as the FD have been traced clearly back to writings about nondifferentiable, infinitely self-similar functions, which are important in the mathematical definition of fractals, around the time that calculus was discovered in the mid-1600s."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"These works were accompanied by perhaps the most pivotal point in the development of the concept of a FD through the work of Hausdorff in the early 1900s who defined a ""fractional"" dimension that has come to be named after him and is frequently invoked in defining modern fractals."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,The concept of a FD rests in unconventional views of scaling and dimension.

FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"The theoretical pattern that the digital images represent, however, has no discrete pixel-like pieces, but rather is composed of an infinite number of infinitely scaled segments joined at different angles and does indeed have a FD of 1.2619."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"As is the case with dimensions determined for lines, squares, and cubes, FDs are general descriptors that do not uniquely define patterns."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"It is found however that many physical surface phenomena cannot readily be interpreted with reference to such descriptors, thus FD is increasingly applied to establish correlations between surface structure in terms of scaling behavior and performance."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"The FDs of surfaces have been employed to explain and better understand phenomena in areas of contact mechanics,  frictional behavior, electrical contact resistance and transparent conducting oxides."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,The concept of FD described in this article is a basic view of a complicated construct.
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"In practice, however, FDs can be determined using techniques that approximate scaling and detail from limits estimated from regression lines over log vs log plots of size vs scale."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,Several formal mathematical definitions of different types of FD are listed below.
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,MultiFDs: a special case of Rényi dimensions where scaling behaviour varies in different parts of the pattern.
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,Many real-world phenomena exhibit limited or statistical fractal properties and FDs that have been estimated from sampled data using computer based fractal analysis techniques.
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"Practically, measurements of FD are affected by various methodological issues, and are sensitive to numerical or experimental noise and limitations in the amount of data."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"Nonetheless, the field is rapidly growing as estimated FDs for statistically self-similar phenomena may have many practical applications in various fields including
astronomy, 
acoustics, 
diagnostic imaging,
ecology,
electrochemical processes,
image analysis,
biology and medicine,"
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"In colloidal physics, systems composed of particles with various FDs arise."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"To describe these systems, it is convenient  to speak about a distribution of FDs, and eventually, a time evolution of the latter: a process that is driven by a complex interplay between aggregation and coalescence."
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,It has been found that many real world networks are self similar and can be characterized by a FD.
FD,fractal dimension,EXT,"Furthermore, networks models  embedded in space can have a continuous FD which depends on the distribution of long-range links."

TU,translation unit,EXT,"According to this point of view, a TU is a stretch of text on which attention is focused to be represented as a whole in the target language."
TU,translation unit,EXT,"It also relates to how experienced the translator in question is: language learners take a word as a TU, whereas experienced translators isolate and translate units of meaning in the form of phrases, clauses or sentences."
SCCs,strongly connected components,EXT,The SCCs of an arbitrary directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected.
SCCs,strongly connected components,EXT,"It is possible to test the strong connectivity of a graph, or to find its SCCs, in linear time )."
SCCs,strongly connected components,EXT,"The binary relation of being strongly connected is an equivalence relation, and the induced subgraphs of its equivalence classes are called SCCs."
SCCs,strongly connected components,EXT,"The collection of SCCs forms a partition of the set of vertices of G.

If each strongly connected component is contracted to a single vertex, the resulting graph is a directed acyclic graph, the condensation of G. A directed graph is acyclic if and only if it has no strongly connected subgraphs with more than one vertex, because a directed cycle is strongly connected and every nontrivial strongly connected component contains at least one directed cycle."
SCCs,strongly connected components,EXT,Several algorithms based on depth first search compute SCCs in linear time.
SCCs,strongly connected components,EXT,"Tarjan's SCCs algorithm, published by Robert Tarjan in 1972, performs a single pass of depth first search."

RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"It is also common to combine RT with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy or some mixture of the four."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Most common cancer types can be treated with RT in some way.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Total body irradiation  is a RT technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of RT that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,The use of RT in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Different cancers respond to RT in different ways.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Renal cell cancer and melanoma are generally considered to be radioresistant but RT is still a palliative option for many patients with metastatic melanoma.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Combining RT with immunotherapy is an active area of investigation and has shown some promise for melanoma and other cancers.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"For example, leukemias are not generally curable with RT, because they are disseminated through the body."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of RT if they are at an early stage."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Metastatic cancers are generally incurable with RT because it is not possible to treat the whole body.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,The response of a tumor to RT is also related to its size.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,The most common technique is surgical resection prior to RT.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,This is most commonly seen in the treatment of breast cancer with wide local excision or mastectomy followed by adjuvant RT.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Another method is to shrink the tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical RT.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of RT.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Modern RT aims to reduce side effects to a minimum and to help the patient understand and deal with side effects that are unavoidable.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"This is not a general side effect of RT, and mechanistically is associated only with treatment of the stomach or abdomen , or with RT to certain nausea-producing structures in the head during treatment of certain head and neck tumors, most commonly the vestibules of the inner ears."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Epithelial surfaces may sustain damage from RT.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and for up to about one week following the end of RT, and the skin may break down."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,The lower bowel may be treated directly with radiation  or be exposed by RT to other pelvic structures .
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"As part of the general inflammation that occurs, swelling of soft tissues may cause problems during RT."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"If surgery is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate, the patient may receive steroids during RT to reduce swelling."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Lymphedema, a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling, can result from damage to the lymphatic system sustained during RT."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,It is the most commonly reported complication in breast RT patients who receive adjuvant axillary radiotherapy following surgery to clear the axillary lymph nodes .
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Studies have found RT as the cause of secondary malignancies for only a small minority of patients.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,In cases of radiation applied to the head RT may cause cognitive decline.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Radiation-induced polyneuropathy, ICD-10-CM Code G62.82,  occurs in approximately 1-5% of those receiving RT."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"During the first two weeks after fertilization, RT is lethal but not teratogenic."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Hypopituitarism commonly develops after RT for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumours, head and neck tumours, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,There are rigorous procedures in place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of RT to patients.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the RT machine Therac-25 was responsible for at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Although medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and other members of the RT treatment team are working to eliminate them."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"When Dupuytren's disease is at the nodules and cords stage or fingers are at a minimal deformation stage of less than 10 degrees, then RT is used to prevent further progress of the disease."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,One of the major limitations of photon RT is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in oxygen.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,See proton therapy for a good example of the different effects of intensity-modulated RT  vs. charged particle therapy.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"The amount of radiation used in photon RT is measured in grays , and varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Many other factors are considered by radiation oncologists when selecting a dose, including whether the patient is receiving chemotherapy, patient comorbidities, whether RT is being administered before or after surgery, and the degree of success of surgery."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"In RT, three-dimensional dose distributions may be evaluated using the dosimetry technique known as gel dosimetry."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Fractionation regimens are individualised between different RT centers and even between individual doctors.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Historically, the three main divisions of RT are :

external beam RT  or teletherapy;
brachytherapy or sealed source RT; and
systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Particle therapy is a special case of external beam RT where the particles are protons or heavier ions.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,External beam RT ===
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Conventional external beam RT ====
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Historically conventional external beam RT  was delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy x-ray units, medical linear accelerators that generate high-energy x-rays, or with machines that were similar to a linear accelerator in appearance, but used a sealed radioactive source like the one shown above."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal RT has become the standard treatment for almost all tumor sites."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Stereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam RT.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Stereotactic body RT  refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"==== Virtual simulation, and 3-dimensional conformal RT ===="
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,The planning of RT treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and/or MRI scanners and planning software.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"An enhancement of virtual simulation is 3-dimensional conformal RT , in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a beam's eye view  using a multileaf collimator  and a variable number of beams."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Intensity-modulated RT  =
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Intensity-modulated RT  is an advanced type of high-precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional RT  is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,This new technology is called image-guided RT  or four-dimensional RT.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"AT differs from conventional RT in several aspects; it neither relies upon radioactive nuclei to cause cellular radiation damage at a cellular dimension, nor engages multiple external pencil-beams from different directions to zero-in to deliver a dose to the targeted area with reduced dose outside the targeted tissue/organ locations."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,Contact x-ray brachytherapy  is a type of RT using kilovoltage X-rays applied close to the tumour to treat rectal cancer.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam RT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other RT techniques.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each RT dose.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"This approach decreases the exposure of healthy tissue and resulting side effects, compared both to external beam RT and older methods of breast brachytherapy."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,These microspheres are used for the treatment approach known as selective internal RT.
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Intraoperative radiotherapy ===

Intraoperative RT  is applying therapeutic levels of radiation to a target area, such as a cancer tumor, while the area is exposed during surgery."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Medicine has used RT as a treatment for cancer for more than 100 years, with its earliest roots traced from the discovery of X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Röntgen."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"Emil Grubbe of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use X-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896.The field of RT began to grow in the early 1900s largely due to the groundbreaking work of Nobel Prize–winning scientist Marie Curie , who discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium in 1898."
RT,radiation therapy,EXT,"The advent of new imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging  in the 1970s and positron emission tomography  in the 1980s, has moved RT from 3-D conformal to intensity-modulated RT  and to image-guided RT  tomotherapy."

RT,response time,EXT,"In technology, RT is the time a system or functional unit takes to react to a given input."
RT,response time,EXT,"Ignoring transmission time for a moment, the RT is the sum of the service time and wait time."
RT,response time,EXT,"The busier the device is, the more dramatic the RT increases will seem as you approach 100% busy; all of that increase is caused by increases in wait time, which is the result of all the requests waiting in queue that have to run first."
RT,response time,EXT,Transmission time gets added to RT when your request and the resulting response has to travel over a network and it can be very significant.
RT,response time,EXT,In real-time systems the RT of a task or thread is defined as the time elapsed between the dispatch  to the time when it finishes its job .
RT,response time,EXT,"Display monitors with long RTs would create display motion blur around moving objects, making them unacceptable for rapidly moving images."
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,"For three-axis control, RW must be mounted along at least three directions, with extra wheels providing redundancy to the attitude control system."
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,"For this reason, RW are often used to aim spacecraft carrying cameras or telescopes."
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,"Over time, RW may build up enough stored momentum to exceed the maximum speed of the wheel, called saturation, which will need to be cancelled."
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,Spacecraft using RW ==
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,The failure of one or more RW can cause a spacecraft to lose its ability to maintain attitude  and thus potentially cause a mission failure.
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,"From July 2012 to May 11, 2013, two out of the four RW in the Kepler telescope failed."
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,"On August 15, 2013, engineers concluded that Kepler's RW cannot be recovered and that planet searching using the transit method  could not continue."
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,"Although the failed RW still function, they are experiencing friction exceeding acceptable levels, and consequently hindering the ability of the telescope to properly orient itself."
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,"The Kepler telescope was returned to its ""point rest state"", a stable configuration that uses small amounts of thruster fuel to compensate for the failed RW, while the Kepler team considered alternative uses for Kepler that do not require the extreme accuracy in its orientation as needed by the original mission."
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,"However, a problem with another of the spacecraft's RW forced Dawn to briefly delay its departure from Vesta's gravity until September 5, 2012, and it planned to use thruster jets instead of the RW during the three-year journey  to Ceres."
RW,reaction wheels,EXT,The loss of the RW limited the camera observations on the approach to Ceres.

RW,random walk,EXT,A Wiener process is the scaling limit of RW in dimension 1.
RW,random walk,EXT,"This means that if you take a RW with very small steps, you get an approximation to a Wiener process ."

RW,random walk,EXT,"Formally, if B is the space of all paths of length L with the maximum topology, and if M is the space of measure over B with the norm topology, then the convergence is in the space M. Similarly, a Wiener process in several dimensions is the scaling limit of RW in the same number of dimensions."

DA,data assimilation,EXT,"Because DA developed out of the field of numerical weather prediction, it initially gained popularity amongst the geosciences."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"In fact, one of the most cited publication in all of the geosciences is an application of DA to reconstruct the observed history of the atmosphere."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,Details of the DA process =
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"Classically, DA has been applied to chaotic dynamical systems that are too difficult to predict using simple extrapolation methods."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"At any update time, DA usually takes a forecast  and applies a correction to the forecast based on a set of observed data and estimated errors that are present in both the observations and the forecast itself."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,Much of the work in DA is focused on adequately estimating the appropriate weighting factor based on intricate knowledge of the errors in the system.
DA,data assimilation,EXT,One of the common mathematical philosophical perspectives is to view DA as a Bayesian estimation problem.
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"In numerical weather prediction applications, DA is most widely known as a method for combining observations of meteorological variables such as temperature and atmospheric pressure with prior forecasts in order to initialize numerical forecast models.


=="
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"These observations are irregularly spaced, so they are processed by DA and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis, indicating the need for a DA scheme."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"Then ""objective analysis""  was introduced for automated DA."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"The 4DDA method which is currently most successful is hybrid incremental 4D-Var, where an ensemble is used to augment the climatological background error covariances at the start of the DA time window, but the background error covariances are evolved during the time window by a simplified version of the NWP forecast model."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,This DA method is used operationally at forecast centres such as the Met Office.
DA,data assimilation,EXT,The process of creating the analysis in DA often involves minimization of a cost function.
DA,data assimilation,EXT,Factors driving the rapid development of DA methods for NWP models include:
DA,data assimilation,EXT,Bayesian networks may also be used in a DA approach to assess natural hazards such as landslides.
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"Given the abundance of spacecraft data for other planets in the solar system, DA is now also applied beyond the Earth to obtain re-analyses of the atmospheric state of extraterrestrial planets."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,Mars is the only extraterrestrial planet to which DA has been applied so far.
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"Two methods of DA have been applied to these datasets: an Analysis Correction scheme  and two Ensemble Kalman Filter schemes, both using a global circulation model of the martian atmosphere as forward model."
DA,data assimilation,EXT,Dealing with biased data is a serious challenge in DA.
DA,data assimilation,EXT,This increasing non-linearity in the models and observation operators poses a new problem in the DA.
DA,data assimilation,EXT,"The existing DA methods such as many variants of ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods, well established with linear or near-linear models, are being assessed on non-linear models, as well as many new methods are being developed e.g. particle filters for high-dimensional problems, hybrids DA methods."

DA,domain adaptation,EXT,"Note that, when more than one source distribution is available the problem is referred to as multi-source DA."
DA,domain adaptation,EXT,"In DA, the source and target domains all have the same feature space ; in contrast, transfer learning includes cases where the target domain's feature space is different from the source feature space or spaces."
DA,domain adaptation,EXT,The modern machine-learning community has many different strategies to attempt to gain better DA.
DA,domain adaptation,EXT,The main difference between supervised learning and DA is that in the latter situation we study two different  distributions
DA,domain adaptation,EXT,The DA task then consists of the transfer of knowledge from the source domain
DA,domain adaptation,EXT,The different types of DA ==
DA,domain adaptation,EXT,There are several contexts of DA.
DA,domain adaptation,EXT,"The unsupervised DA: the learning sample contains a set of labeled source examples, a set of unlabeled source examples and a set of unlabeled target examples."
DA,domain adaptation,EXT,"The semi-supervised DA:  in this situation, we also consider a ""small"" set of labeled target examples."

PC,point cloud,EXT,"While PCs can be directly rendered and inspected, PCs are often converted to polygon mesh or triangle mesh models, NURBS surface models, or CAD models through a process commonly referred to as surface reconstruction."
PC,point cloud,EXT,There are many techniques for converting a PC to a 3D surface.
PC,point cloud,EXT,"Some approaches, like Delaunay triangulation, alpha shapes, and ball pivoting, build a network of triangles over the existing vertices of the PC, while other approaches convert the PC into a volumetric distance field and reconstruct the implicit surface so defined through a marching cubes algorithm."

PC,principal component,EXT,It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few PCs to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible.

PC,principal component,EXT,"For example, selecting L = 2 and keeping only the first two PCs finds the two-dimensional plane through the high-dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out, so if the data contains clusters these too may be most spread out, and therefore most visible to be plotted out in a two-dimensional diagram; whereas if two directions through the data  are chosen at random, the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other, and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other, making them indistinguishable."
PC,principal component,EXT,"One approach, especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables, is to reduce them to a few PCs and then run the regression against them, a method called PC regression."
PC,principal component,EXT,"However, with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few PCs compared to the same noise variance, the proportionate effect of the noise is less—the first few components achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio."
PC,principal component,EXT,"PCA thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few PCs, which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction; while the later PCs may be dominated by noise, and so disposed of without great loss."
PC,principal component,EXT,"If the dataset is not too large, the significance of the PCs can be tested using parametric bootstrap, as an aid in determining how many PCs to retain ."

PC,principal component,EXT,The second PC corresponds to the same concept after all correlation with the first PC has been subtracted from the points.
PC,principal component,EXT,PCA essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the PCs.
PC,principal component,EXT,"If we have just two variables and they have the same sample variance and are positively correlated, then the PCA will entail a rotation by 45° and the ""weights""  for the two variables with respect to the PC will be equal."
PC,principal component,EXT,"But if we multiply all values of the first variable by 100, then the first PC will be almost the same as that variable, with a small contribution from the other variable, whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable."
PC,principal component,EXT,Mean subtraction  is necessary for performing classical PCA to ensure that the first PC describes the direction of maximum variance.
PC,principal component,EXT,"If mean subtraction is not performed, the first PC might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data."
PC,principal component,EXT,"Mean-centering is unnecessary if performing a PCs analysis on a correlation matrix, as the data are already centered after calculating correlations."

PC,principal component,EXT,Mean subtraction is an integral part of the solution towards finding a PC basis that minimizes the mean square error of approximating the data.

PL,programming language,EXT,A PL is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.
PL,programming language,EXT,Most PLs consist of instructions for computers.
PL,programming language,EXT,"There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general PLs."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Thousands of different PLs have been created, and more are being created every year."
PL,programming language,EXT,Many PLs are written in an imperative form  while other languages use the declarative form .
PL,programming language,EXT,The description of a PL is usually split into the two components of syntax  and semantics .
PL,programming language,EXT,"A PL is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Some authors restrict the term ""PL"" to those languages that can express all possible algorithms."
PL,programming language,EXT,Traits often considered important for what constitutes a PL include:
PL,programming language,EXT,"A computer PL is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer performing some kind of computation or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk drives, robots, and so on."
PL,programming language,EXT,"More generally, a PL may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine."
PL,programming language,EXT,"It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a PL includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language."
PL,programming language,EXT,"In most practical contexts, a PL involves a computer; consequently, PLs are usually defined and studied this way."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while PLs also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines."
PL,programming language,EXT,The practical necessity that a PL support adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle.
PL,programming language,EXT,"ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called PLs."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which define structured data, are not usually considered PLs."
PL,programming language,EXT,The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with PL.
PL,programming language,EXT,One usage describes PLs as a subset of computer languages.
PL,programming language,EXT,"Another usage regards PLs as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines, and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources."
PL,programming language,EXT,John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much PLs as are the languages intended for execution.
PL,programming language,EXT,"He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are PLs, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of PL concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats."
PL,programming language,EXT,Machine languages were later termed first-generation PLs .
PL,programming language,EXT,"The next step was the development of the so-called second-generation PLs  or assembly languages, which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer."
PL,programming language,EXT,"The first high-level PLs, or third-generation PLs , were written in the 1950s."
PL,programming language,EXT,"An early high-level PL to be designed for a computer was Plankalkül, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945."
PL,programming language,EXT,"As a PL, it used a compiler to automatically convert the language into machine code."
PL,programming language,EXT,The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first compiled high-level PL.
PL,programming language,EXT,"It was the first widely used high-level general purpose PL to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Another early PL was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English PL and implemented a prototype."
PL,programming language,EXT,The increased use of high-level languages introduced a requirement for low-level PLs or system PLs.

PL,programming language,EXT,"Prolog, designed in 1972, was the first logic PL."
PL,programming language,EXT,"In 1978, ML built a polymorphic type system on top of Lisp, pioneering statically typed functional PLs."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Each of these languages spawned descendants, and most modern PLs count at least one of them in their ancestry."
PL,programming language,EXT,"The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of structured programming, and whether PLs should be designed to support it."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Edsger Dijkstra, in a famous 1968 letter published in the Communications of the ACM, argued that Goto statements should be eliminated from all ""higher level"" PLs."
PL,programming language,EXT,"The United States government standardized Ada, a systems PL derived from Pascal and intended for use by defense contractors."
PL,programming language,EXT,Fourth-generation PLs  are computer PLs that aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs.
PL,programming language,EXT,"Fifth-generation PLs  are PLs based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer."
PL,programming language,EXT,All PLs have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them .
PL,programming language,EXT,A PL's surface form is known as its syntax.
PL,programming language,EXT,"Most PLs are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages."
PL,programming language,EXT,"On the other hand, there are some PLs which are more graphical in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program."
PL,programming language,EXT,The grammar needed to specify a PL can be classified by its position in the Chomsky hierarchy.
PL,programming language,EXT,"The syntax of most PLs can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are context-free grammars."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Newer PLs like Java and C# have definite assignment analysis, a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics."
PL,programming language,EXT,"A significant amount of academic research went into formal semantics of PLs, which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner."
PL,programming language,EXT,Results from this field of research have seen limited application to PL design and implementation outside academia.
PL,programming language,EXT,"A type system defines how a PL classifies values and expressions into types, how it can manipulate those types and how they interact."
PL,programming language,EXT,"For example, the data represented by ""this text between the quotes"" is a string, and in many PLs dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Additionally, some PLs allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Most PLs have an associated core library , which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language."
PL,programming language,EXT,A significant difference is that a PL can be fully described and studied in its entirety since it has a precise and finite definition.
PL,programming language,EXT,"While constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a PL has."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Many PLs have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Although there have been attempts to design one ""universal"" PL that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role."
PL,programming language,EXT,"The need for diverse PLs arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:

Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmers."
PL,programming language,EXT,One common trend in the development of PLs has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of abstraction.
PL,programming language,EXT,The earliest PLs were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer.
PL,programming language,EXT,"As new PLs have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions."
PL,programming language,EXT,"The specification of a PL is an artifact that the language users and the implementors can use to agree upon whether a piece of source code is a valid program in that language, and if so what its behavior shall be."
PL,programming language,EXT,"A PL specification can take several forms, including the following:"
PL,programming language,EXT,An implementation of a PL provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software.
PL,programming language,EXT,"There are, broadly, two approaches to PL implementation: compilation and interpretation."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Although most of the most commonly used PLs have fully open specifications and implementations, many PLs exist only as proprietary PLs with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Proprietary PLs are commonly domain specific languages or internal scripting languages for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Some PLs exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, Oracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java PL, and Microsoft's C# PL, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has Common Language Runtime  as a closed environment."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, Erlang was originally an Ericsson's internal PL."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Thousands of different PLs have been created, mainly in the computing field."
PL,programming language,EXT,Individual software projects commonly use five PLs or more.
PL,programming language,EXT,"On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a PL."
PL,programming language,EXT,"A PL provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data."
PL,programming language,EXT,Determining which is the most widely used PL is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context.
PL,programming language,EXT,"Combining and averaging information from various internet sites, stackify.com reported the ten most popular PLs as : Java, C, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, VB .NET, R, PHP, and MATLAB."
PL,programming language,EXT,A dialect of a PL or a data exchange language is a  variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature.
PL,programming language,EXT,The BASIC PL has many dialects.
PL,programming language,EXT,There is no overarching classification scheme for PLs.
PL,programming language,EXT,A given PL does not usually have a single ancestor language.
PL,programming language,EXT,"In broad strokes, PLs divide into programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use, with general-purpose PLs distinguished from domain-specific PLs."
PL,programming language,EXT,"Traditionally, PLs have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands."
PL,programming language,EXT,These are generally called imperative PLs.
PL,programming language,EXT,"A great deal of research in PLs has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of declarative programming."
PL,programming language,EXT,"By purpose, PLs might be considered general purpose, system PLs, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages ."
PL,programming language,EXT,A PL may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm.
PL,programming language,EXT,"For instance, most PLs use English language keywords, while a minority do not."
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,Observation of PL at a certain energy can be viewed as an indication that an electron populated an excited state associated with this transition energy.
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,"While this is generally true in atoms and similar systems, correlations and other more complex phenomena also act as sources for PL in many-body systems such as semiconductors."
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,Time-resolved PL  is a method where the sample is excited with a light pulse and then the decay in PL with respect to time is measured.
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,"In general, both exciton populations and plasma, uncorrelated electrons and holes, can act as sources for PL as described in the semiconductor-luminescence equations."
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,"In experiments, disorder can lead to localization of carriers and hence drastically increase the PL life times as localized carriers cannot as easily find nonradiative recombination centers as can free ones."
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,Researchers from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology  have studied the photoinduced entropy  of InGaN/GaN p-i-n double-heterostructure and AlGaN nanowires using temperature-dependent PL.
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,They have also related the change in entropy generation to the change in photocarrier dynamics in the nanowire active regions using results from time-resolved PL study.
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,"To study the photoinduced entropy, the scientists have developed a mathematical model that considers the net energy exchange resulting from photoexcitation and PL."
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,"In phosphor thermometry, the temperature dependence of the PL process is exploited to measure temperature."
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,The relaxation processes can be studied using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to find the decay lifetime of the PL.
PL,photoluminescence,EXT,"These techniques can be combined with microscopy, to map the intensity  or the lifetime  of the PL across a sample ."
FE,finite element,EXT,The FE method  is the most widely used method for solving problems of engineering and mathematical models.
FE,finite element,EXT,"To solve a problem, the FEM subdivides a large system into smaller, simpler parts that are called FEs."
FE,finite element,EXT,The FE method formulation of a boundary value problem finally results in a system of algebraic equations.
FE,finite element,EXT,The simple equations that model these FEs are then assembled into a larger system of equations that models the entire problem.
FE,finite element,EXT,Studying or analyzing a phenomenon with FEM is often referred to as FE analysis .
FE,finite element,EXT,"FEM is best understood from its practical application, known as FE analysis ."
FE,finite element,EXT,"While it is difficult to quote a date of the invention of the FE method, the method originated from the need to solve complex elasticity and structural analysis problems in civil and aeronautical engineering."
FE,finite element,EXT,"The method was called the finite difference method based on variation principle, which was another independent invention of the FE method."
FE,finite element,EXT,"The FE method obtained its real impetus in the 1960s and 1970s by the developments of J. H. Argyris with co-workers at the University of Stuttgart, R. W. Clough with co-workers at UC Berkeley, O. C. Zienkiewicz with co-workers Ernest Hinton, Bruce Irons and others at Swansea University, Philippe G. Ciarlet at the University of Paris 6 and Richard Gallagher with co-workers at Cornell University."
FE,finite element,EXT,Further impetus was provided in these years by available open source FE software programs.
FE,finite element,EXT,"NASA sponsored the original version of NASTRAN, and UC Berkeley made the FE program SAP IV widely available."
FE,finite element,EXT,A rigorous mathematical basis to the FE method was provided in 1973 with the publication by Strang and Fix.
FE,finite element,EXT,The structure of FE methods ===
FE,finite element,EXT,"A FE method is characterized by a variational formulation, a discretization strategy, one or more solution algorithms, and post-processing procedures."
FE,finite element,EXT,"the creation of FE meshes,  the definition of basis function on reference elements  and "
FE,finite element,EXT,Postprocessing procedures are designed for the extraction of the data of interest from a FE solution.
FE,finite element,EXT,We will demonstrate the FE method using two sample problems from which the general method can be extrapolated.

FE,finite element,EXT,"The generalized FE method  uses local spaces consisting of functions, not necessarily polynomials, that reflect the available information on the unknown solution and thus ensure good local approximation."
FE,finite element,EXT,Mixed FE method ===
FE,finite element,EXT,The mixed FE method is a type of FE method in which extra independent variables are introduced as nodal variables during the discretization of a partial differential equation problem.
FE,finite element,EXT,The extended FE method  is a numerical technique based on the generalized FE method  and the partition of unity method .
FE,finite element,EXT,It extends the classical FE method by enriching the solution space for solutions to differential equations with discontinuous functions.
FE,finite element,EXT,"Extended FE methods enrich the approximation space so that it can naturally reproduce the challenging feature associated with the problem of interest: the discontinuity, singularity, boundary layer, etc."
FE,finite element,EXT,"Moreover, treating problems with discontinuities with XFEMs suppresses the need to mesh and re-mesh the discontinuity surfaces, thus alleviating the computational costs and projection errors associated with conventional FE methods, at the cost of restricting the discontinuities to mesh edges."
FE,finite element,EXT,"It is increasingly being adopted by other commercial FE software, with a few plugins and actual core implementations available ."
FE,finite element,EXT,Scaled boundary FE method  =
FE,finite element,EXT,The introduction of the scaled boundary FE method  came from Song and Wolf .
FE,finite element,EXT,It is a semi-analytical fundamental-solutionless method which combines the advantages of both the FE formulations and procedures and the boundary element discretization.
FE,finite element,EXT,It was developed by combining meshfree methods with the FE method.
FE,finite element,EXT,Spectral element methods combine the geometric flexibility of FEs and the acute accuracy of spectral methods.

The butterfly network  is often used to illustrate how linear NC can outperform routing."
NC,network coding,EXT,"Random linear NC  is a simple yet powerful encoding scheme, which in broadcast transmission schemes allows close to optimal throughput using a decentralized algorithm."
NC,network coding,EXT,"It should however be noted that, although random linear NC has excellent throughput performance, if a receiver obtains an insufficient number of packets, it is extremely unlikely that they can recover any of the original packets."
NC,network coding,EXT,Linear NC is still a relatively new subject.
NC,network coding,EXT,Hence any gains from NC are strongly impacted by the underlying scheduler and will deviate from the gains seen in wired networks.
NC,network coding,EXT,"Although, originally NC was proposed to be used at Network layer , in wireless networks, NC has been widely used in either MAC layer or PHY layer."
NC,network coding,EXT,"It has been shown that NC when used in wireless mesh networks need attentive design and thoughts to exploit the advantages of packet mixing, else advantages cannot be realized."
NC,network coding,EXT,It is not evident how NC can co-exist and not jeopardize what existing congestion and flow control algorithms are doing for our Internet.
NC,network coding,EXT,"Applications ==

NC,network coding,EXT,"Unlike other coding, linear NC is not entirely applicable
in a system due to its narrow specific usage scenario."

SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,Link SE ==
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"The link SE of a digital communication system is measured in bit/s/Hz, or, less frequently but unambiguously, in /Hz."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"Alternatively, the SE may be measured in bit/symbol, which is equivalent to bits per channel use , implying that the net bit rate is divided by the symbol rate  or line code pulse rate."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"Link SE is typically used to analyse the efficiency of a digital modulation method or line code, sometimes in combination with a forward error correction  code and other physical layer overhead."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"The SE or modulation efficiency is 56,000/3,100 = 18.1 /Hz downstream, and 48,000/3,100 = 15.5 /Hz upstream."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"Thus, the SE can not exceed 2N /Hz in the baseband transmission case."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"Since QAM is a form of double sideband passband transmission, the SE cannot exceed N ="
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"Since the transmitted signal before passband filtering can be considered as baseband transmission, the SE cannot exceed 2N ="
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"As seen above, a higher SE is achieved if we consider the smaller passband bandwidth."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"If a forward error correction code is used, the SE is reduced from the uncoded modulation efficiency figure."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"Example 6: If a forward error correction  code with code rate 1/2 is added, meaning that the encoder input bit rate is one half the encoder output rate, the SE is 50% of the modulation efficiency."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"In exchange for this reduction in SE, FEC usually reduces the bit-error rate, and typically enables operation at a lower signal to noise ratio .An upper bound for the SE possible without bit errors in a channel with a certain SNR, if ideal error coding and modulation is assumed, is given by the Shannon–Hartley theorem."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"If the SNR is 1, corresponding to 0 decibel, the link SE can not exceed 1 /Hz for error-free detection  according to Shannon–Hartley regardless of the modulation and coding."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"The link SE of a wireless telephony link may also be expressed as the maximum number of simultaneous calls over 1 MHz frequency spectrum in erlangs per megahertz, or E/MHz."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"In wireless networks, the link SE can be somewhat misleading, as larger values are not necessarily more efficient in their overall use of radio spectrum."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"In a wireless network, high link SE may result in high sensitivity to co-channel interference , which affects the capacity."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,error correction reduce the SE in /Hz but substantially lower the required signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to non-spread spectrum techniques.
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"This can allow for much denser geographical frequency reuse that compensates for the lower link SE, resulting in approximately the same capacity  over the same bandwidth, using the same number of base station transmitters."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"As discussed below, a more relevant measure for wireless networks would be system SE in bit/s/Hz per unit area."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"However, in closed communication links such as telephone lines and cable TV networks, and in noise-limited wireless communication system where co-channel interference is not a factor, the largest link SE that can be supported by the available SNR is generally used."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,System SE or area SE ==
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"In digital wireless networks, the system SE or area SE is typically measured in /Hz per unit area, in /Hz per cell, or in /Hz per site."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"Thus, the maximum possible system SE in /Hz per site is 1/4 of the link SE."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"Then each cell has access to 1/12 of the available spectrum, and the system SE in /Hz per cell or /Hz per sector is 1/12 of the link SE."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"The system SE of a cellular network may also be expressed as the maximum number of simultaneous phone calls per area unit over 1 MHz frequency spectrum in E/MHz per cell, E/MHz per sector, E/MHz per site, or /m2."
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,Low link SE in /Hz does not necessarily mean that an encoding scheme is inefficient from a system SE point of view.
SE,spectral efficiency,EXT,"The SE can be improved by radio resource management techniques such as efficient fixed or dynamic channel allocation, power control, link adaptation and diversity schemes."

SE,software engineering,EXT,"The origins of the term ""SE"" have been attributed to various sources."
SE,software engineering,EXT,"The term ""SE"" appeared in a list of services offered by companies in the June 1965 issue of COMPUTERS and AUTOMATION and was used more formally in the August 1966 issue of Communications of the ACM "
SE,software engineering,EXT,"it is also associated with the title of a NATO conference in 1968 by Professor Friedrich L. Bauer, the first conference on SE."
SE,software engineering,EXT,"Independently, Margaret Hamilton named the discipline ""SE"" during the Apollo missions to give what they were doing legitimacy."
SE,software engineering,EXT,"Watts Humphrey founded the SEI Software Process Program, aimed at understanding and managing the SE process."
SE,software engineering,EXT,"Modern, generally accepted best-practices for SE have been collected by the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 subcommittee and published as the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge ."
SE,software engineering,EXT,"Notable definitions of SE include:

""the systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software""—The Bureau of Labor Statistics—IEEE Systems and SE – Vocabulary

SE,software engineering,EXT,"One standard international curriculum for undergraduate SE degrees was defined by the Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula of the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery, and updated in 2014."
SE,software engineering,EXT,Similar experience can be gained through military service in SE.
SE,software engineering,EXT,"The IEEE Computer Society and the ACM, the two main US-based professional organizations of SE, publish guides to the profession of SE."
SE,software engineering,EXT,"Due to its relative newness as a field of study, formal education in SE is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum, and many software engineers hold computer science degrees."
SE,software engineering,EXT,Broader certification of general SE skills is available through various professional societies.
SE,software engineering,EXT,"The ACM examined the possibility of professional certification of software engineers in the late 1990s, but eventually decided that such certification was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of SE."
SE,software engineering,EXT,The PEO does not recognize any online or distance education however; and does not consider Computer Science programs to be equivalent to SE programs despite the tremendous overlap between the two.
SE,software engineering,EXT,This had a negative impact on many aspects of the SE profession.
SE,software engineering,EXT,"For example, some students in the developed world avoid education related to SE because of the fear of offshore outsourcing  and of being displaced by foreign visa workers."
SE,software engineering,EXT,"Although statistics do not currently show a threat to SE itself; a related career, computer programming does appear to have been affected."
SE,software engineering,EXT,As with other aspects of SE research is ongoing in this and related areas.
SE,software engineering,EXT,"These approaches are specified in various SE books and research papers, always with the connotations of predictability, precision, mitigated risk and professionalism."
SE,software engineering,EXT,"The concept is so new that it is rarely understood, and it is widely misinterpreted, including in SE textbooks, papers, and among the communities of programmers and crafters."
SE,software engineering,EXT,"One of the core issues in SE is that its approaches are not empirical enough because a real-world validation of approaches is usually absent, or very limited and hence SE is often misinterpreted as feasible only in a ""theoretical environment."""
SE,software engineering,EXT,"Edsger Dijkstra, the founder of many of the concepts used within software development today, rejected the idea of ""SE"" up until his death in 2002, arguing that those terms were poor analogies for what
he called the ""radical novelty"" of computer science:"
SE,software engineering,EXT,"As economics is known as ""The Miserable Science"", SE should be known as ""The Doomed Discipline"", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory."

SE,systems engineering,EXT,The SE process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process.
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"The SE process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved, and identifying the most probable or highest impact failures that can occur – SE involves finding solutions to these problems."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,The term SE can be traced back to Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1940s.
SE,systems engineering,EXT,The continuing evolution of SE comprises the development and identification of new methods and modeling techniques.
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"Popular tools that are often used in the SE context were developed during these times, including USL, UML, QFD, and IDEF0."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"In 1990, a professional society for SE, the National Council on Systems Engineering , was founded by representatives from a number of U.S. corporations and organizations."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,NCOSE was created to address the need for improvements in SE practices and education.
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"Schools in several countries offer graduate programs in SE, and continuing education options are also available for practicing engineers."

SE,systems engineering,EXT,"As an approach, SE is holistic and interdisciplinary in flavour."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"Traditional SE was seen as a branch of engineering in the classical sense, that is, as applied only to physical systems, such as spacecraft and aircraft."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"More recently, SE has evolved to a take on a broader meaning especially when humans were seen as an essential component of a system."

SE,systems engineering,EXT,"This perspective is often replicated in educational programs, in that SE courses are taught by faculty from other engineering departments, which helps create an interdisciplinary environment."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"The need for SE arose with the increase in complexity of systems and projects, in turn exponentially increasing the possibility of component friction, and therefore the unreliability of the design."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"The development of smarter control algorithms, microprocessor design, and analysis of environmental systems also come within the purview of SE."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,Defining and characterizing such systems and subsystems and the interactions among them is one of the goals of SE.
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"One way to understand the motivation behind SE is to see it as a method, or practice, to identify and improve common rules that exist within a wide variety of systems."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"Keeping this in mind, the principles of SE – holism, emergent behavior, boundary, et al. – can be applied to any system, complex or otherwise, provided systems thinking is employed at all levels."
SE,systems engineering,EXT,An analysis by the INCOSE Systems Engineering center of excellence  indicates that optimal effort spent on SE is about 15–20% of the total project effort.

SE,systems engineering,EXT,Education in SE can be taken as Systems-centric or Domain-centric:
SE,systems engineering,EXT,Systems-centric programs treat SE as a separate discipline and most of the courses are taught focusing on SE principles and practice.
SE,systems engineering,EXT,Domain-centric programs offer SE as an option that can be exercised with another major field in engineering.
SE,systems engineering,EXT,"Systems engineering tools are strategies, procedures, and techniques that aid in performing SE on a project or product."

BI,business intelligence,EXT,"Among myriad uses, BI tools empower organizations to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability of products and services for different  market segments, and to gauge the impact of marketing efforts."
BI,business intelligence,EXT,The earliest known use of the term BI is in Richard Millar Devens' Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes .
BI,business intelligence,EXT,"Throughout Holland, Flanders, France, and Germany, he maintained a complete and perfect train of BI."
BI,business intelligence,EXT,"The ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to BI."
BI,business intelligence,EXT,"When Hans Peter Luhn, a researcher at IBM, used the term BI in an article published in 1958, he employed the Webster's Dictionary definition of intelligence: ""the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal."

BI,business intelligence,EXT,"Though the term BI is sometimes a synonym for competitive intelligence , BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes, and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors."
BI,business intelligence,EXT,"If understood broadly, BI can include the subset of competitive intelligence."
BI,business intelligence,EXT,"Thomas Davenport, professor of information technology and management at Babson College argues that BI should be divided into querying, reporting, Online analytical processing , an ""alerts"" tool, and business analytics."

FM,formal methods,EXT,"In computer science, specifically software engineering and hardware engineering, FM are a particular kind of mathematically rigorous techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems."
FM,formal methods,EXT,"The use of FM for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design."
FM,formal methods,EXT,This has been dubbed FM lite.
FM,formal methods,EXT,"As with programming language semantics, styles of FM may be roughly classified as follows:"
FM,formal methods,EXT,Lightweight FM =
FM,formal methods,EXT,Some practitioners believe that the FM community has overemphasized full formalization of a specification or design.
FM,formal methods,EXT,"As an alternative, various lightweight FM, which emphasize partial specification and focused application, have been proposed."
FM,formal methods,EXT,"Examples of this lightweight approach to FM include the Alloy object modelling notation, Denney's synthesis of some aspects of the Z notation with use case driven development, and the CSK VDM Tools."

FM,flash memory,EXT,"While EPROMs had to be completely erased before being rewritten, NAND-type FM may be erased, written and read in blocks "
FM,flash memory,EXT,A FM device typically consists of one or more FM chips  along with a separate FM controller chip.
FM,flash memory,EXT,"NAND or NOR FM is also often used to store configuration data in numerous digital products, a task previously made possible by EEPROM or battery-powered static RAM."
FM,flash memory,EXT,One key disadvantage of FM is that it can only endure a relatively small number of write cycles in a specific block.
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Example applications of FM include computers, PDAs, digital audio players, digital cameras, mobile phones, synthesizers, video games, scientific instrumentation, industrial robotics, and medical electronics."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"In addition to being non-volatile, FM offers fast read access times, although not as fast as static RAM or ROM."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Because erase cycles are slow, the large block sizes used in FM erasing give it a significant speed advantage over non-flash EEPROM when writing large amounts of data."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"As of 2019, FM costs much less than byte-programmable EEPROM and had become the dominant memory type wherever a system required a significant amount of non-volatile solid-state storage."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"The origins of FM can be traced back to the development of the floating-gate MOSFET , also known as the floating-gate transistor."
FM,flash memory,EXT,This led to Masuoka's invention of FM at Toshiba in 1980.
FM,flash memory,EXT,Toshiba commercially launched NAND FM in 1987.
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on-chip FM, to a more typical 10,000 or 100,000 erase cycles, up to 1,000,000 erase cycles."
FM,flash memory,EXT,Flash memory cards and SSDs store data using multiple NAND FM chips.
FM,flash memory,EXT,"NEC demonstrated multi-level cell  technology in 1998, with an 80 Mb FM chip storing 2 bits per cell."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"STMicroelectronics also demonstrated MLC in 2000, with a 64 Mbb NOR FM chip."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Samsung Electronics introduced triple-level cell  technology storing 3-bits per cell, and began mass-producing NAND chips with TLC technology in 2010.Charge trap flash  technology was first disclosed in 1967 by John Szedon and Ting L. Chu but was not used for FM production until 2002."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"In 1991, NEC researchers including N. Kodama, K. Oyama and Hiroki Shirai described a type of FM with a charge trap method."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"In 1998, Boaz Eitan of Saifun Semiconductors  patented a FM technology named NROM that took advantage of a charge trapping layer to replace the floating gate used in conventional FM designs."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"In 2000, an Advanced Micro Devices  research team led by Richard M. Fastow, Egyptian engineer Khaled Z. Ahmed and Jordanian engineer Sameer Haddad  demonstrated a charge-trapping mechanism for NOR FM cells."

FM,flash memory,EXT,"The same year, Samsung combined 3D IC chip stacking with its 3D V-NAND and TLC technologies to manufacture its 512 GB KLUFG8R1EM FM chip with eight stacked 64-layer V-NAND chips."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"In FM, each memory cell resembles a standard metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor  except that the transistor has two gates instead of one."
FM,flash memory,EXT,Modern NOR FM chips are divided into erase segments .
FM,flash memory,EXT,"NAND FM forms the core of the removable USB storage devices known as USB flash drives, as well as most memory card formats and solid-state drives available today."
FM,flash memory,EXT,The vertical collection is electrically identical to the serial-linked groups in which conventional NAND FM is configured.
FM,flash memory,EXT,"One limitation of FM is that, although it can be read or programmed a byte or a word at a time in a random access fashion, it can be erased only a block at a time."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"In other words, FM  offers random-access read and programming operations but does not offer arbitrary random-access rewrite or erase operations."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Although data structures in FM cannot be updated in completely general ways, this allows members to be ""removed"" by marking them as invalid."
FM,flash memory,EXT,Another limitation is that FM has a finite number of program –  erase cycles .
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Micron Technology and Sun Microsystems announced an SLC NAND FM chip rated for 1,000,000 P/E cycles on 17 December 2008.The guaranteed cycle count may apply only to block zero , or to all blocks ."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"For portable consumer devices, these wear out management techniques typically extend the life of the FM beyond the life of the device itself, and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"For high-reliability data storage, however, it is not advisable to use FM that would have to go through a large number of programming cycles."
FM,flash memory,EXT,The method used to read NAND FM can cause nearby cells in the same memory block to change over time .
FM,flash memory,EXT,"The low-level interface to FM chips differs from those of other memory types such as DRAM, ROM, and EEPROM, which support bit-alterability  and random access via externally accessible address buses."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Because of this, most microprocessors can use NOR FM as execute in place  memory, meaning that programs stored in NOR flash can be executed directly from the NOR flash without needing to be copied into RAM first."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Because of the series connection and removal of wordline contacts, a large grid of NAND FM cells will occupy perhaps only 60% of the area of equivalent NOR cells ."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"This design choice made random-access of NAND FM impossible, but the goal of NAND flash was to replace mechanical hard disks, not to replace ROMs.


=="
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Examples of endurance cycle ratings listed in datasheets for NAND and NOR flash, as well as in storage devices using FM, are provided."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Because of the particular characteristics of FM, it is best used with either a controller to perform wear leveling and error correction or specifically designed flash file systems, which spread writes over the media and deal with the long erase times of NOR flash blocks."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Removable FM cards, SSDs, eMMC/eUFS chips and USB flash drives have built-in controllers to perform wear leveling and error correction so use of a specific flash file system does not add any benefit."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"The FM chips inside them are sized in strict binary multiples, but the actual total capacity of the chips is not usable at the drive interface."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Serial flash is a small, low-power FM that provides only serial access to the data - rather than addressing individual bytes, the user reads or writes large contiguous groups of bytes in the address space serially."
FM,flash memory,EXT,One more recent application for FM is as a replacement for hard disks.
FM,flash memory,EXT,The cost per gigabyte of FM remains significantly higher than that of hard disks.
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Also FM has a finite number of P/E cycles, but this seems to be currently under control since warranties on flash-based SSDs are approaching those of current hard drives."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"The Q1-SSD and Q30-SSD launch was delayed and finally was shipped in late August 2006.The first flash-memory based PC to become available was the Sony Vaio UX90, announced for pre-order on 27 June 2006 and began to be shipped in Japan on 3 July 2006 with a 16Gb FM hard drive."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"As of 2012, there are attempts to use FM as the main computer memory, DRAM."
FM,flash memory,EXT,It is unclear how long FM will persist under archival conditions .
FM,flash memory,EXT,"One source states that, in 2008, the FM industry includes about US$9.1 billion in production and sales."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"Other sources put the FM market at a size of more than US$20 billion in 2006, accounting for more than eight percent of the overall semiconductor market and more than 34 percent of the total semiconductor memory market."
FM,flash memory,EXT,It can take up to 10 weeks to produce a FM chip.
FM,flash memory,EXT,"The following are the largest NAND FM manufacturers, as of the first quarter of 2019."
FM,flash memory,EXT,"In addition to individual FM chips, FM is also embedded in microcontroller  chips and system-on-chip  devices."

FM,frequency modulation,EXT,"In analog FM, such as radio broadcasting, of an audio signal representing voice or music, the instantaneous frequency deviation, i.e. the difference between the frequency of the carrier and its center frequency, has a functional relation to the modulating signal amplitude."
FM,frequency modulation,EXT,"Digital data can be encoded and transmitted with a type of FM known as frequency-shift keying , in which the instantaneous frequency of the carrier is shifted among a set of frequencies."
FM,frequency modulation,EXT,"In radio transmission, an advantage of FM is that it has a larger signal-to-noise ratio and therefore rejects radio frequency interference better than an equal power amplitude modulation  signal."
FM,frequency modulation,EXT,Frequency modulation and phase modulation are the two complementary principal methods of angle modulation; phase modulation is often used as an intermediate step to achieve FM.
FM,frequency modulation,EXT,The harmonic distribution of a sine wave carrier modulated by such a sinusoidal signal can be represented with Bessel functions; this provides the basis for a mathematical understanding of FM in the frequency domain.

NR,new radio,EXT,5G NR  is a NR access technology  developed by 3GPP for the 5G  mobile network.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"In the field of molecular biology, NRs are a class of proteins found within cells that are responsible for sensing steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,The regulation of gene expression by NRs generally only happens when a ligand — a molecule that affects the receptor's behavior — is present.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"More specifically, ligand binding to a NR results in a conformational change in the receptor, which, in turn, activates the receptor, resulting in up- or down-regulation of gene expression."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,A unique property of NRs that differentiates them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"As a consequence, NRs play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"As discussed below, NRs may be classified according to either mechanism or homology."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"There are 270 NRs in the nematode C. elegans alone, 21 in D. melanogaster and other insects, 73 in zebrafish."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Humans, mice, and rats have respectively 48, 49, and 47 NRs each."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Ligands that bind to and activate NRs include lipophilic substances such as endogenous hormones, vitamins A and D, and xenobiotic endocrine disruptors."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Because the expression of a large number of genes is regulated by NRs, ligands that activate these receptors can have profound effects on the organism."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Many of these regulated genes are associated with various diseases, which explains why the molecular targets of approximately 13% of U.S. Food and Drug Administration  approved drugs target NRs."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"A number of NRs, referred to as orphan receptors, have no known  endogenous ligands."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Other NRs, such as CAR and PXR appear to function as xenobiotic sensors up-regulating the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize these xenobiotics."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Most NRs have molecular masses between 50,000 and 100,000 daltons."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,The A-B domain is highly variable in sequence between various NRs.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT, Ligand binding domain : Moderately conserved in sequence and highly conserved in structure between the various NRs.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT, C-terminal domain: Highly variable in sequence between various NRs.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,Small lipophilic substances such as natural hormones diffuse through the cell membrane and bind to NRs located in the cytosol  or nucleus
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Accordingly, NRs may be subdivided into the following four mechanistic classes:


=="
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Ligand binding to type I NRs in the cytosol results in the dissociation of heat shock proteins, homo-dimerization, translocation  from the cytoplasm into the cell nucleus, and binding to specific sequences of DNA known as hormone response elements ."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Type I NRs bind to HREs consisting of two half-sites separated by a variable length of DNA, and the second half-site has a sequence inverted from the first ."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Type I NRs include members of subfamily 3, such as the androgen receptor, estrogen receptors, glucocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,It has been noted that some of the NR subfamily 2 NRs may bind to direct repeat instead of inverted repeat HREs.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"In addition, some NRs that bind either as monomers or dimers, with only a single DNA binding domain of the receptor attaching to a single half site HRE."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"These NRs are considered orphan receptors, as their endogenous ligands are still unknown."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"The NR/DNA complex then recruits other proteins that transcribe DNA downstream from the HRE into messenger RNA and eventually protein, which causes a change in cell function."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"In the absence of ligand, type II NRs are often complexed with corepressor proteins."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,Ligand binding to the NR causes dissociation of corepressor and recruitment of coactivator proteins.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Type II NRs include principally subfamily 1, for example the retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor and thyroid hormone receptor."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,Type III NRs  are similar to type
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"However, type III NRs, in contrast to type I, bind to direct repeat instead of inverted repeat HREs."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Type IV NRs bind either as monomers or dimers, but only a single DNA binding domain of the receptor binds to a single half site HRE."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,Binding of agonist ligands  to NRs induces a conformation of the receptor that preferentially binds coactivator proteins.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,Binding of antagonist ligands to NRs in contrast induces a conformation of the receptor that preferentially binds corepressor proteins.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Depending on the receptor involved, the chemical structure of the ligand and the tissue that is being affected, NR ligands may display dramatically diverse effects ranging in a spectrum from agonism to antagonism to inverse agonism."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,The activity of endogenous ligands  when bound to their cognate NRs is normally to upregulate gene expression.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,Other synthetic NR ligands have no apparent effect on gene transcription in the absence of endogenous ligand.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,However they block the effect of agonist through competitive binding to the same binding site in the NR.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,An example of antagonistic NR drug is mifepristone which binds to the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors and therefore blocks the activity of the endogenous hormones cortisol and progesterone respectively.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Finally, some NRs promote a low level of gene transcription in the absence of agonists ."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Synthetic ligands which reduce this basal level of activity in NRs are known as inverse agonists.


==="
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,A number of drugs that work through NRs display an agonist response in some tissues and an antagonistic response in other tissues.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,The most common mechanism of NR action involves direct binding of the NR to a DNA hormone response element.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"However some NRs not only have the ability to directly bind to DNA, but also to other transcription factors."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,One example of a NR that are able to transrepress is the glucocorticoid receptor .
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,The classical direct effects of NRs on gene regulation normally take hours before a functional effect is seen in cells because of the large number of intermediate steps between NR activation and changes in protein expression levels.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"However it has been observed that many effects of the application of nuclear hormones, such as changes in ion channel activity, occur within minutes which is inconsistent with the classical mechanism of NR action."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"While the molecular target for these non-genomic effects of NRs has not been conclusively demonstrated, it has been hypothesized that there are variants of NRs which are membrane associated instead of being localized in the cytosol or nucleus."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"While it has been hypothesized that there are several membrane associated receptors for nuclear hormones, many of the rapid effects have been shown to require canonical NRs."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,This mechanism appears to be conserved in all mammals but not in TRα or any other NRs.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,The following is a list of the 48 known human NRs  categorized according to sequence homology.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,A topic of debate has been on the identity of the ancestral NR as either a ligand-binding or an orphan receptor.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Shortly thereafter, the identification of the ecdysone receptor in Drosophila introduced the idea that NRs were hormonal receptors that bind ligands with a nanomolar affinity."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"At the time, the three known NR ligands were steroids, retinoids, and thyroid hormone, and of those three, both steroids and retinoids were products of terpenoid metabolism."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"In 1992, a comparison of the DNA-binding domain of all known NRs led to the construction of a phylogenic tree of NR that indicated that all NRs shared a common ancestor."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"As a result, there was an increased effort upon uncovering the state of the first NR, and by 1997 an alternative hypothesis was suggested: the ancestral NR was an orphan receptor and it acquired ligand-binding ability over time This hypothesis was proposed based on the following arguments:"
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"The NR sequences that had been identified in the earliest metazoans  were all members of the COUP-TF, RXR, and FTZ-F1 groups of receptors."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Orphan receptors are found amongst all six subfamilies of NRs, while ligand-dependent receptors are found amongst three."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"The phylogenetic position of a given NR within the tree correlates to its DNA-binding domain and dimerization abilities, but there is no identified relationship between a ligand-dependent NR and the chemical nature of its ligand."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"In 1997, it was discovered that NRs did not exist in static off and on conformations, but that a ligand could alter the equilibrium between the two states."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Furthermore, it was found that NRs could be regulated in a ligand-independent manner, through either phosphorylation or other post-translational modifications."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,The A. queenslandica genome contains two NRs known as AqNR1 and AqNR2 and both were characterized to bind and be regulated by ligands.
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"Furthermore, the NRs found in cnidarians were found to have structural ligands in mammals, which could mirror the ancestral situation."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,"A combination of this recent evidence, as well as an in-depth study of the physical structure of the NR ligand binding domain has led to the emergence of a new hypothesis regarding the ancestral state of the NR."
NR,nuclear receptor,EXT,Below is a brief selection of key events in the history of NR research.
ART,adaptive radix tree,EXT,The ART is a radix tree variant that integrates adaptive node sizes to the radix tree.
ART,adaptive radix tree,EXT,"The major difference between the radix tree and the ART is its variable size for each node based on the number of child elements, which grows while adding new entries."
ART,adaptive radix tree,EXT,"Hence, the ART leads to a better use of space without reducing its speed."

GS,gold standard,EXT,A GS is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold.
GS,gold standard,EXT,The GS was widely used in the 19th and early part of the 20th century.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Most nations abandoned the GS as the basis of their monetary systems at some point in the 20th century, although many still hold substantial gold reserves."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"The GS was originally implemented as a gold specie standard, by the circulation of gold coins."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Lastly, countries may implement a gold exchange standard, where the government guarantees a fixed exchange rate, not to a specified amount of gold, but rather to the currency of another country that uses a GS."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"This creates a de facto GS, where the value of the means of exchange has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is independent of the inherent value of the means of exchange itself."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Following Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704, the British West Indies GS was a de facto GS based on the Spanish gold doubloon."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"In 1717, Sir Isaac Newton, the master of the Royal Mint, established a new mint ratio between silver and gold that had the effect of driving silver out of circulation and putting Britain on a GS."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Australia and New Zealand adopted the British GS, as did the British West Indies, while Newfoundland was the only British Empire territory to introduce its own gold coin."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"According to the strict interpretation of the GS, this 1844 act marked the establishment of a full GS for British money."
GS,gold standard,EXT,The pound left the GS in 1931 and a number of currencies of countries that historically had performed a large amount of their trade in sterling were pegged to sterling instead of to gold.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"The Bank of England took the decision to leave the GS abruptly and unilaterally.

GS,gold standard,EXT,"Following Germany's decision after the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War to extract reparations to facilitate a move to the GS, Japan gained the needed reserves after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Towards the end of the 19th century, some silver standard countries began to peg their silver coin units to the GSs of the United Kingdom or the United States."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"When adopting the GS, many European nations changed the name of their currency, for instance from Daler  or Gulden  to Crown, since the former names were traditionally associated with silver coins and the latter with gold coins."

GS,gold standard,EXT,"For example, Germany had gone off the GS in 1914, and could not effectively return to it because War reparations had cost it much of its gold reserves."
GS,gold standard,EXT,The U.S. did not suspend the GS during the war.
GS,gold standard,EXT,By 1927 many countries had returned to the GS.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Abandonment of the GS ==

The gold specie standard ended in the United Kingdom and the rest of the British Empire at the outbreak of World War I, when Treasury notes replaced the circulation of gold sovereigns and gold half sovereigns."
GS,gold standard,EXT,The end of the GS was successfully effected by the Bank of England through appeals to patriotism urging citizens not to redeem paper money for gold specie.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"It was only in 1925, when Britain returned to the GS in conjunction with Australia and South Africa, that the gold specie standard was officially ended."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"John Maynard Keynes, citing deflationary dangers, argued against resumption of the GS."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Many other countries followed Britain in returning to the GS, leading to a period of relative stability but also deflation."
GS,gold standard,EXT,This state of affairs lasted until the Great Depression  forced countries off the GS.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"On September 19, 1931, speculative attacks on the pound led the Bank of England to abandon the GS, ostensibly ""temporarily""."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"However, the ostensibly temporary departure from the GS had unexpectedly positive effects on the economy, leading to greater acceptance of departing from the GS."
GS,gold standard,EXT,The interwar partially-backed GS was inherently unstable because of the conflict between the expansion of liabilities to foreign central banks and the resulting deterioration in the Bank of England's reserve ratio.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"===

Economists, such as Barry Eichengreen, Peter Temin and Ben Bernanke, blame the GS of the 1920s for prolonging the economic depression which started in 1929 and lasted for about a decade."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"In the United States, adherence to the GS prevented the Federal Reserve from expanding the money supply to stimulate the economy, fund insolvent banks and fund government deficits that could ""prime the pump"" for an expansion."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Once off the GS, it became free to engage in such money creation."
GS,gold standard,EXT,The GS limited the flexibility of the central banks' monetary policy by limiting their ability to expand the money supply.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"The foreign loans became questionable once Britain, Germany, Austria and other European countries went off the GS in 1931 and weakened confidence in the dollar."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Recovery in the United States was slower than in Britain, in part due to Congressional reluctance to abandon the GS and float the U.S. currency as Britain had done."
GS,gold standard,EXT,Alan Greenspan wrote that the bank failures of the 1930s were sparked by Great Britain dropping the GS in 1931.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Under the Bretton Woods international monetary agreement of 1944, the GS was kept without domestic convertibility."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"After the Second World War, a system similar to a GS and sometimes described as a ""gold exchange standard"" was established by the Bretton Woods Agreements."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Representative money and the GS protect citizens from hyperinflation and other abuses of monetary policy, as were seen in some countries during the Great Depression."
GS,gold standard,EXT,Countries that left the GS earlier than other countries recovered from the Great Depression sooner.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"For example, Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries, which left the GS in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"The connection between leaving the GS and the severity and duration of the depression was consistent for dozens of countries, including developing countries."
GS,gold standard,EXT,A full or 100%-reserve GS exists when the monetary authority holds sufficient gold to convert all the circulating representative money into gold at the promised exchange rate.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Gold standard proponents have said, ""Once a money is established, any stock of money becomes compatible with any amount of employment and real income."" While prices would necessarily adjust to the supply of gold, the process may involve considerable economic disruption, as was experienced during earlier attempts to maintain GSs."
GS,gold standard,EXT,International GSs often limit which entities have the right to redeem currency for gold.
GS,gold standard,EXT,A poll of forty prominent U.S. economists conducted by the IGM Economic Experts Panel in 2012 found that none of them believed that returning to the GS would be economically beneficial.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"The specific statement with which the economists were asked to agree or disagree was: ""If the U.S. replaced its discretionary monetary policy regime with a GS, defining a 'dollar' as a specific number of ounces of gold, the price-stability and employment outcomes would be better for the average American."""
GS,gold standard,EXT,"A 1995 study reported on survey results among economic historians showing that two-thirds of economic historians disagreed that the GS ""was effective in stabilizing prices and moderating business-cycle fluctuations during the nineteenth century."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"""The economist Allan H. Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University was known for refuting Ron Paul's advocacy of the GS from the 1970s onward."

GS,gold standard,EXT,"According to Michael D. Bordo, the GS has three benefits: ""its record as a stable nominal anchor; its automaticity; and its role as a credible commitment mechanism."""
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Long-term price stability has been described as one of the virtues of the GS, but historical data shows that the magnitude of short run swings in prices were far higher under the GS."
GS,gold standard,EXT,The GS provides fixed international exchange rates between participating countries and thus reduces uncertainty in international trade.
GS,gold standard,EXT,A GS does not allow some types of financial repression.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists' antagonism toward the GS."
GS,gold standard,EXT,The unequal distribution of gold deposits makes the GS more advantageous for those countries that produce gold.
GS,gold standard,EXT,Some economists believe that the GS acts as a limit on economic growth.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Because a GS requires that money be backed in the metal, then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow."""
GS,gold standard,EXT,A GS means that the money supply would be determined by the gold supply and hence monetary policy could no longer be used to stabilize the economy.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Although the GS brings long-run price stability, it is historically associated with high short-run price volatility."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"The consensus view is that the GS contributed to the severity and length of the Great Depression, as under the GS central banks could not expand credit at a fast enough rate to offset deflationary forces."
GS,gold standard,EXT,Hamilton contended that the GS is susceptible to speculative attacks when a government's financial position appears weak.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"For example, the U.S. was forced to contract the money supply and raise interest rates in September 1931 to defend the dollar after speculators forced the UK off the GS."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Devaluing a currency under a GS would generally produce sharper changes than the smooth declines seen in fiat currencies, depending on the method of devaluation."
GS,gold standard,EXT,A GS provides practical constraints against the measures that central banks might otherwise use to respond to economic crises.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"A return to the GS was considered by the U.S. Gold Commission back in 1982, but found only minority support."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan acknowledged he was one of ""a small minority"" within the central bank that had some positive view on the GS."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"In a 1966 essay he contributed to a book by Ayn Rand, titled ""Gold and Economic Freedom"", Greenspan argued the case for returning to a 'pure' GS; in that essay he described supporters of fiat currencies as ""welfare statists"" intending to use monetary policy to finance deficit spending."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"More recently he claimed that by focusing on targeting inflation ""central bankers have behaved as though we were on the GS"", rendering a return to the standard unnecessary."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Similarly, economists like Robert Barro argued that whilst some form of ""monetary constitution"" is essential for stable, depoliticized monetary policy, the form this constitution takes—for example, a GS, some other commodity-based standard, or a fiat currency with fixed rules for determining the quantity of money—is considerably less important."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"The GS is supported by many followers of the Austrian School of Economics, free-market libertarians and some supply-siders."
GS,gold standard,EXT,"Former congressman Ron Paul is a long-term, high-profile advocate of a GS, but has also expressed support for using a standard based on a basket of commodities that better reflects the state of the economy."
GS,gold standard,EXT,A 2012 survey of forty economists by the University of Chicago business school found that none agreed that returning to a GS would improve price stability and employment outcomes for the average American.
GS,gold standard,EXT,"In 2015, some Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential election advocated for a GS, based on concern that the Federal Reserve's attempts to increase economic growth may create inflation."

ACC,accuracy,EXT,"In measurement of a set, ACC is closeness of the measurements to a specific value, while precision is the closeness of the measurements to each other."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"More commonly, it is a description of systematic errors, a measure of statistical bias; low ACC causes a difference between a result and a ""true"" value."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"Alternatively, ISO defines ACC as describing a combination of both types of observational error above , so high ACC requires both high precision and high trueness."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"In the first, more common definition of ""ACC"" above, the two concepts are independent of each other, so a particular set of data can be said to be either accurate, or precise, or both, or neither.

ACC,accuracy,EXT,"In the fields of science and engineering, the ACC of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's true value."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"Although the two words precision and ACC can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"The field of statistics, where the interpretation of measurements plays a central role, prefers to use the terms bias and variability instead of ACC and precision: bias is the amount of inACC and variability is the amount of imprecision."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve ACC."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,Eliminating the systematic error improves ACC but does not change precision.
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"In addition to ACC and precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"In numerical analysis, ACC is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"In military terms, ACC refers primarily to the ACC of fire , the precision of fire expressed by the closeness of a grouping of shots at and around the centre of the target."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"In industrial instrumentation, ACC is the measurement tolerance, or transmission of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,The ACC and precision of a measurement process is usually established by repeatedly measuring some traceable reference standard.
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"With regard to ACC we can distinguish:

the difference between the mean of the measurements and the reference value, the bias."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,A common convention in science and engineering is to express ACC and/or precision implicitly by means of significant figures.
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"A shift in the meaning of these terms appeared with the publication of the ISO 5725 series of standards in 1994, which is also reflected in the 2008 issue of the ""BIPM International Vocabulary of Metrology"" , items 2.13 and 2.14.According to ISO 5725-1, the general term ""ACC"" is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true value."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"That is, the ACC is the proportion of correct predictions  among the total number of cases examined."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"To make the context clear by the semantics, it is often referred to as the ""Rand ACC"" or ""Rand index""."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"The formula for quantifying binary ACC is:

Accuracy = /(TP +"
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"One reason is that there is not a single ""true value"" of a quantity, but rather two possible true values for every case, while ACC is an average across all cases and therefore takes into account both values."
ACC,accuracy,EXT,"In psychometrics and psychophysics, the term ACC is interchangeably used with validity and constant error."

BR,belief revision,EXT,"The logical formalization of BR is researched in philosophy, in databases, and in artificial intelligence for the design of rational agents."
BR,belief revision,EXT,What makes BR non-trivial is that several different ways for performing this operation may be possible.
BR,belief revision,EXT,The main assumption of BR is that of minimal change: the knowledge before and after the change should be as similar as possible.
BR,belief revision,EXT,"If the considered language of the formulae representing beliefs is propositional, the Ramsey test gives a consistent definition for counterfactual conditionals in terms of a BR operator."
BR,belief revision,EXT,"This distinction is instead done by the foundational approach to BR, which is related to foundationalism in philosophy."
BR,belief revision,EXT,"In order to distinguish the foundational approach to BR to that based on deductively closed knowledge bases, the latter is called the coherentist approach."
BR,belief revision,EXT,This representation was translated to a computational model and an anytime algorithm for BR was developed.
BR,belief revision,EXT,A different realization of the foundational approach to BR is based on explicitly declaring the dependences among beliefs.
BR,belief revision,EXT,Williams provided the first generalization of BR iteration using transmutations.
BR,belief revision,EXT,They differ on how these orderings are interpreted: preferences in social choice theory; plausibility in BR.
BR,belief revision,EXT,"Another difference is that the alternatives are explicitly enumerated in social choice theory, while they are the propositional models over a given alphabet in BR."
BR,belief revision,EXT,The problem about BR that is the most studied from the point of view of computational complexity is that of query answering in the propositional case.
BR,belief revision,EXT,"More generally, query answering is the problem of telling whether a formula is entailed by the result of a BR, which could be update, merging, revision, iterated revision, etc."
BR,belief revision,EXT,"Another problem that has received some attention is that of model checking, that is, checking whether a model satisfies the result of a BR."
BR,belief revision,EXT,"Since a deductively closed knowledge base is infinite, complexity studies on BR operators working on deductively closed knowledge bases are done in the assumption that such deductively closed knowledge base are given in the form of an equivalent finite knowledge base."
BR,belief revision,EXT,A distinction is made among BR operators and BR schemes.
BR,belief revision,EXT,The complexity of query answering and model checking in the propositional case is in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy for most BR operators and schemas.

BR,best response,EXT,"Instead of BR correspondences, some models use smoothed BR functions."
BR,best response,EXT,"These functions are similar to the BR correspondence, except that the function does not ""jump"" from one pure strategy to another."
BR,best response,EXT,"The difference is illustrated in Figure 8, where black represents the BR correspondence and the other colors each represent different smoothed BR functions."
BR,best response,EXT,"In standard BR correspondences, even the slightest benefit to one action will result in the individual playing that action with probability 1."

NS,neutron star,EXT,The entire mass of the Earth at NS density would fit into a sphere of 305 m in diameter .
NS,neutron star,EXT,"A NS has some of the properties of an atomic nucleus, including density  and being composed of nucleons."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In popular scientific writing, NSs are therefore sometimes described as ""giant nuclei""."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"However, in other respects, NSs and atomic nuclei are quite different."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"A nucleus is held together by the strong interaction, whereas a NS is held together by gravity."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The density of a nucleus is uniform, while NSs are predicted to consist of multiple layers with varying compositions and densities."
NS,neutron star,EXT,The magnetic field strength on the surface of NSs ranges from c. 104 to 1011 tesla.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Variations in magnetic field strengths are most likely the main factor that allows different types of NSs to be distinguished by their spectra, and explains the periodicity of pulsars."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The NSs known as magnetars have the strongest magnetic fields, in the range of 108 to 1011 tesla, and have become the widely accepted hypothesis for NS types soft gamma repeaters  and anomalous X-ray pulsars ."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"One hypothesis is that of ""flux freezing"", or conservation of the original magnetic flux during the formation of the NS."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Likewise, a collapsing star begins with a much larger surface area than the resulting NS, and conservation of magnetic flux would result in a far stronger magnetic field."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"However, this simple explanation does not fully explain magnetic field strengths of NSs."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The gravitational field at a NS's surface is about 2×1011 times stronger than on Earth, at around 2.0×1012 m/s2."
NS,neutron star,EXT,Such a strong gravitational field acts as a gravitational lens and bends the radiation emitted by the NS such that parts of the normally invisible rear surface become visible.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"If the radius of the NS is 3GM/c2 or less, then the photons may be trapped in an orbit, thus making the whole surface of that NS visible from a single vantage point, along with destabilizing photon orbits at or below the 1 radius distance of the star."
NS,neutron star,EXT,A fraction of the mass of a star that collapses to form a NS is released in the supernova explosion from which it forms .
NS,neutron star,EXT,The energy comes from  the gravitational binding energy of a NS.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Hence, the gravitational force of a typical NS is huge."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"If an object were to fall from a height of one meter on a NS 12 kilometers in radius, it would reach the ground at around 1400 kilometers per second."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Because of the enormous gravity, time dilation between a NS and Earth is significant."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"For example, eight years could pass on the surface of a NS, yet ten years would have passed on Earth, not including the time-dilation effect of its very rapid rotation."
NS,neutron star,EXT,The most likely radii for a given NS mass are bracketed by models AP4  and MS2 .
NS,neutron star,EXT,"BE is the ratio of gravitational binding energy mass equivalent to the observed NS gravitational mass of ""M"" kilograms with radius ""R"" meters,"

  A 2 M☉ NS would not be more compact than 10,970 meters radius ."
NS,neutron star,EXT,The equation of state for a NS is not yet known.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"However, with a NS the increased effects of general relativity can no longer be ignored."
NS,neutron star,EXT,Several equations of state have been proposed  and current research is still attempting to constrain the theories to make predictions of NS matter.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"For example, a 1.5 M☉ NS could have a radius of 10.7, 11.1, 12.1 or 15.1 kilometers ."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Current understanding of the structure of NSs is defined by existing mathematical models, but it might be possible to infer some details through studies of neutron-star oscillations."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Asteroseismology, a study applied to ordinary stars, can reveal the inner structure of NSs by analyzing observed spectra of stellar oscillations."
NS,neutron star,EXT,Current models indicate that matter at the surface of a NS is composed of ordinary atomic nuclei crushed into a solid lattice with a sea of electrons flowing through the gaps between them.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"If the surface temperature exceeds 106 kelvin , the surface should be fluid instead of the solid phase that might exist in cooler NSs ("
NS,neutron star,EXT,"temperature <106 kelvin).The ""atmosphere"" of a NS is hypothesized to be at most several micrometers thick, and its dynamics are fully controlled by the NS's magnetic field."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Neutron stars are usually observed to pulse radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation, and NSs observed with pulses are called pulsars."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Pulsars' radiation is thought to be caused by particle acceleration near their magnetic poles, which need not be aligned with the rotational axis of the NS."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The radiation emanating from the magnetic poles of NSs can be described as magnetospheric radiation, in reference to the magnetosphere of the NS."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"It is not to be confused with magnetic dipole radiation, which is emitted because the magnetic axis is not aligned with the rotational axis, with a radiation frequency the same as the NS's rotational frequency."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"If the axis of rotation of the NS is different to the magnetic axis, external viewers will only see these beams of radiation whenever the magnetic axis point towards them during the NS rotation."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Therefore, periodic pulses are observed, at the same rate as the rotation of the NS.


=="
NS,neutron star,EXT,Non-pulsating NSs =
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In addition to pulsars, non-pulsating NSs have also been identified, although they may have minor periodic variation in luminosity."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"This seems to be a characteristic of the X-ray sources known as Central Compact Objects in Supernova remnants , which are thought to be young, radio-quiet isolated NSs."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In addition to radio emissions, NSs have also been identified in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The majority of NSs detected, including those identified in optical, X-ray, and gamma rays, also emit radio waves; the Crab Pulsar produces electromagnetic emissions across the spectrum."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"However, there exist NSs called radio-quiet NSs, with no radio emissions detected."
NS,neutron star,EXT,A newborn NS can rotate many times a second.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Over time, NSs slow, as their rotating magnetic fields in effect radiate energy associated with the rotation; older NSs may take several seconds for each revolution."
NS,neutron star,EXT,The rate at which a NS slows its rotation is usually constant and very small.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The periodic time  is the rotational period, the time for one rotation of a NS."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"It is defined as periodic time increase per unit time; it is a dimensionless quantity, but can be given the units of s⋅s−1 .The spin-down rate  of NSs usually falls within the range of 10−22 to 10−9 s⋅s−1, with the shorter period "
NS,neutron star,EXT,observable NSs usually having smaller P-dot.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"As a NS ages, its rotation slows ; eventually, the rate of rotation will become too slow to power the radio-emission mechanism, and the NS can no longer be detected."
NS,neutron star,EXT,P and P-dot allow minimum magnetic fields of NSs to be estimated.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"P and P-dot can also be combined with NS's moment of inertia to estimate a quantity called spin-down luminosity, which is given the symbol"
NS,neutron star,EXT,"For NSs where the spin-down luminosity is comparable to the actual luminosity, the NSs are said to be ""rotation powered""."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"With NSs such as magnetars, where the actual luminosity exceeds the spin-down luminosity by about a factor of one hundred, it is assumed that the luminosity is powered by magnetic dissipation, rather than being rotation powered."
NS,neutron star,EXT,P and P-dot can also be plotted for NSs to create a P–P-dot diagram.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"It encodes a tremendous amount of information about the pulsar population and its properties, and has been likened to the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram in its importance for NSs."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Sometimes NSs absorb orbiting matter from companion stars, increasing the rotation rate and reshaping the NS into an oblate spheroid."
NS,neutron star,EXT,This causes an increase in the rate of rotation of the NS of over a hundred times per second in the case of millisecond pulsars.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The most rapidly rotating NS currently known, PSR J1748-2446ad, rotates at 716 revolutions per second."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"A 2007 paper reported the detection of an X-ray burst oscillation, which provides an indirect measure of spin, of 1122 Hz from the NS XTE J1739-285, suggesting 1122 rotations a second."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Sometimes a NS will undergo a glitch, a sudden small increase of its rotational speed or spin up."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Glitches are thought to be the effect of a starquake—as the rotation of the NS slows, its shape becomes more spherical."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Recent work, however, suggests that a starquake would not release sufficient energy for a NS glitch; it has been suggested that glitches may instead be caused by transitions of vortices in the theoretical superfluid core of the NS from one metastable energy state to a lower one, thereby releasing energy that appears as an increase in the rotation rate."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"An ""anti-glitch"", a sudden small decrease in rotational speed, or spin down, of a NS has also been reported."
NS,neutron star,EXT,Current NS models do not predict this behavior.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"At present, there are about 2,000 known NSs in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, the majority of which have been detected as radio pulsars."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Neutron stars are mostly concentrated along the disk of the Milky Way, although the spread perpendicular to the disk is large because the supernova explosion process can impart high translational speeds  to the newly formed NS."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Some of the closest known NSs are RX J1856.5−3754, which is about 400 light-years from Earth, and PSR J0108−1431 about 424 light years."
NS,neutron star,EXT,RX J1856.5-3754 is a member of a close group of NSs called The Magnificent Seven.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Another nearby NS that was detected transiting the backdrop of the constellation Ursa Minor has been nicknamed Calvera by its Canadian and American discoverers, after the villain in the 1960 film The Magnificent Seven."
NS,neutron star,EXT,Neutron stars are only detectable with modern technology during the earliest stages of their lives  and are vastly outnumbered by older NSs that would only be detectable through their blackbody radiation and gravitational effects on other stars.
NS,neutron star,EXT,Binary NS systems =
NS,neutron star,EXT,"=

About 5% of all known NSs are members of a binary system."
NS,neutron star,EXT,The formation and evolution of binary NSs can be a complex process.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Neutron stars have been observed in binaries with ordinary main-sequence stars, red giants, white dwarfs, or other NSs."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"According to modern theories of binary evolution, it is expected that NSs also exist in binary systems with black hole companions."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The merger of binaries containing two NSs, or a NS and a black hole, has been observed through the emission of gravitational waves."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Binary systems containing NSs often emit X-rays, which are emitted by hot gas as it falls towards the surface of the NS."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The source of the gas is the companion star, the outer layers of which can be stripped off by the gravitational force of the NS if the two stars are sufficiently close."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"As the NS accretes this gas, its mass can increase; if enough mass is accreted, the NS may collapse into a black hole."
NS,neutron star,EXT,The distance between two NSs in a close binary system is observed to shrink as gravitational waves are emitted.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Ultimately, the NSs will come into contact and coalesce."
NS,neutron star,EXT,The coalescence of binary NSs is one of the leading models for the origin of short gamma-ray bursts.
NS,neutron star,EXT,The light emitted in the kilonova is believed to come from the radioactive decay of material ejected in the merger of the two NSs.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Another system is PSR B1620−26, where a circumbinary planet orbits a NS-white dwarf binary system."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"At the meeting of the American Physical Society in December 1933 , Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky proposed the existence of NSs, less than two years after the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In seeking an explanation for the origin of a supernova, they tentatively proposed that in supernova explosions ordinary stars are turned into stars that consist of extremely closely packed neutrons that they called NSs."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Baade and Zwicky correctly proposed at that time that the release of the gravitational binding energy of the NSs powers the supernova: ""In the supernova process, mass in bulk is annihilated""."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Neutron stars were thought to be too faint to be detectable and little work was done on them until November 1967, when Franco Pacini pointed out that if the NSs were spinning and had large magnetic fields, then electromagnetic waves would be emitted."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Unbeknown to him, radio astronomer Antony Hewish and his research assistant Jocelyn Bell at Cambridge were shortly to detect radio pulses from stars that are now believed to be highly magnetized, rapidly spinning NSs, known as pulsars."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In 1967, Iosif Shklovsky examined the X-ray and optical observations of Scorpius X-1 and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from a NS at the stage of accretion."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"This pulsar was later interpreted as an isolated, rotating NS."
NS,neutron star,EXT,The energy source of the pulsar is the rotational energy of the NS.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The majority of known NSs  have been discovered as pulsars, emitting regular radio pulses."
NS,neutron star,EXT,They interpreted this as resulting from a rotating hot NS.
NS,neutron star,EXT,The energy source is gravitational and results from a rain of gas falling onto the surface of the NS from a companion star or the interstellar medium.
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In 1974, Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse discovered the first binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16, which consists of two NSs  orbiting around their center of mass."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"This object spins 642 times per second, a value that placed fundamental constraints on the mass and radius of NSs."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In 2003, Marta Burgay and colleagues discovered the first double NS system where both components are detectable as pulsars, PSR J0737−3039."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"This was substantially higher than any previously measured NS mass , and places strong constraints on the interior composition of NSs."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"Furthermore, this allowed, for the first time, a test of general relativity using such a massive NS."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In August 2017, LIGO and Virgo made first detection of gravitational waves produced by colliding NSs."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In October 2018, astronomers reported that GRB 150101B, a gamma-ray burst event detected in 2015, may be directly related to the historic GW170817 and associated with the merger of two NSs."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"The similarities between the two events, in terms of gamma ray, optical and x-ray emissions, as well as to the nature of the associated host galaxies, are ""striking"", suggesting the two separate events may both be the result of the merger of NSs, and both may be a kilonova, which may be more common in the universe than previously understood, according to the researchers."
NS,neutron star,EXT,"In July 2019, astronomers reported that a new method to determine the Hubble constant, and resolve the discrepancy of earlier methods, has been proposed based on the mergers of pairs of NSs, following the detection of the NS merger of GW170817."

DMN,default mode network,EXT,"In neuroscience, the DMN , also default network, or default state network, is a large-scale brain network primarily composed of the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and angular gyrus."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,Some of them are often anti-correlated with the DMN.
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"In the beginning to mid 2000s, researchers labeled the DMN as the task negative network because it was deactivated when participants had to perform tasks."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"Around 2007, the number of papers referencing the DMN skyrocketed."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"In all years prior to 2007, there were 12 papers published that referenced ""DMN"" or ""default network"" in the title; however, between 2007 and 2014 the number increased to 1,384 papers."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,The DMN is thought to be involved in several different functions:
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"Understanding and remembering a narrativeThe DMN is active during passive rest and mind-wandering which usually involves thinking about others, thinking about one's self, remembering the past, and envisioning the future rather than the task being performed."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"Recent work, however, has challenged a specific mapping between the DMN and mind-wandering, given that the system is important in maintaining detailed representations of task information during working memory encoding."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,Electrocorticography studies  have shown the DMN becomes activated within a fraction of a second after participants finish a task.
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"Additionally, during attention demanding tasks, sufficient deactivation of the DMN at the time of memory encoding has been shown to result in more successful long-term memory consolidation."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"The DMN has shown to deactivate during external goal-oriented tasks such as visual attention or cognitive working memory tasks, thus leading some researchers to label the network as the task-negative network."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,The DMN is an interconnected and anatomically defined set of brain regions.
DMN,default mode network,EXT,attentionThe DMN is most commonly defined with resting state data by putting a seed in the posterior cingulate cortex and examining which other brain areas most correlate with this area.
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"It has been shown that the DMN exhibits the highest overlap in its structural and functional connectivity, which suggests that the structural architecture of the brain may be built in such a way that this particular network is activated by default."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,Functional connectivity analysis in monkeys shows a similar network of regions to the DMN seen in humans.
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"The DMN has been hypothesized to be relevant to disorders including Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia, depression, chronic pain, posttraumatic stress disorder and others."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,People with Alzheimer's disease show a reduction in glucose  within the areas of the DMN.
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"If the DMN is altered, this can change the way one perceives events and their social and moral reasoning, thus making a person more susceptible to major depressive-like symptoms."

Acupuncture – Deactivation of the limbic brain areas and the DMN."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"Psychotherapy – In PTSD, the abnormalities in the DMN normalize in individuals who respond to psychotherapy interventions."
DMN,default mode network,EXT,"Some have argued the brain areas in the DMN only show up together because of the vascular coupling of large arteries and veins in the brain near these areas, not because these areas are actually functionally connected to each other."

TM,tone mapping,EXT,Several TM operators were developed to map high dynamic range  images to standard displays.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,The goals of TM can be differently stated depending on the particular application.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,Various TM operators have been developed in the recent years.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,Examples of common global TM methods are contrast reduction and color inversion.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"A simple example of global TM filter is 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            out
          
        
        ="
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"A perhaps more useful global TM method is gamma compression, which has the filter"
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"An even more sophisticated group of TM algorithms is based on contrast or gradient domain methods, which are 'local'."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"Those TM methods usually produce very sharp images, which preserve very well small contrast details; however, this is often done at the cost of flattening an overall image contrast, and may as a side effect produce halo-like glows around dark objects."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,Examples of such TM methods include: gradient domain high dynamic range compression and A Perceptual Framework for Contrast Processing of High Dynamic Range Images .
TM,tone mapping,EXT,Another approach to TM of HDR images is inspired by the anchoring theory of lightness perception.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,The key concept of this TM method ) is a decomposition of an HDR image into areas  of consistent illumination and the local calculation of the lightness values.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,This approach to TM does not affect the local contrast and preserves the natural colors of an HDR image due to the linear handling of luminance.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"One simple form of TM takes a standard image  and applies unsharp masking with a large radius, which increases local contrast rather than sharpening."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,One of the commonly used TM algorithms is the iCAM06 which is based on both the color appearance model and hierarchical mapping.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,Forms of TM long precede digital photography.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"The manipulation of film and development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in bright sunlight, on printing paper with a relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of TM, although it is not usually called that."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"The normal process of exposure compensation, brightening shadows and altering contrast applied globally to digital images as part of a professional or serious amateur workflow is also a form of TM."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"However, HDR TM, usually using local operators, has become increasingly popular amongst digital photographers as a post-processing technique, where several exposures at different shutter speeds are combined to produce an HDR image and a TM operator is then applied to the result."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"In some cases local TM is used even though the dynamic range of the source image could be captured on the target media, either to produce the distinctive appearance of a locally tone mapped image, or to produce an image closer to the photographer's artistic vision of the scene by removing sharp contrasts, which often look unattractive."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"However, when TM is applied to a single exposure in this way, the intermediate image has only normal dynamic range, and the amount of shadow or highlight detail that can be rendered is only that which was captured in the original exposure."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,One of the original goals of TM was to be able to reproduce a given scene or image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation.
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"For this method, models for the Human Visual System  and the display are first generated, along with a simple TM operator."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"The high dynamic range image is passed to a TM operator, in this case a local operator, which transforms the image into a low dynamic range image suitable for viewing on a monitor."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"Local TM technique of HDR image processing often produces a number of characteristic effects in images such as bright halos around dark objects, dark halos around bright objects, and sometimes a ""cartoon-like"" appearance due to extremely vivid colors and lack of large-scale color variations."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"These results are caused by application of geometric space distortion of captured image along with color space distortion, while only color space distortions are a TM effect, and all other distortions are rather a custom filtering technique than any tone or color space mapping."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"So, the results of local TM are often judged as perverting the nature of a documentalist photographic image and far from photographic realism."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"Reducing dynamic range with TM is often useful in bright sunlit scenes, where the difference in intensity between direct illumination and shadow is great."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"Use of TM in this context may not be apparent from the final image:

		
		
Tone mapping can also produce distinctive visual effects in the final image, such as the visible halo around the tower in the Cornell Law School image below."
TM,tone mapping,EXT,"Halos in images come about because the local TM operator will brighten areas around dark objects, to maintain the local contrast in the original image, which fools the human  visual system into perceiving the dark objects as being dark, even if their actual luminance is the same as that of areas of the image perceived as being bright."

NL,natural language,EXT,"Though the exact definition varies between scholars, NL can broadly be defined in contrast to artificial or constructed languages  and to other communication systems in nature."
NL,natural language,EXT,"All language varieties of world languages are NLs, although some varieties are subject to greater degrees of published prescriptivism or language regulation than others."
NL,natural language,EXT,"But even an official language with a regulating academy, such as Standard French with the French Academy, is classified as a NL , as its prescriptive points do not make it either constructed enough to be classified as a constructed language or controlled enough to be classified as a controlled NL."
NL,natural language,EXT,Controlled NLs are subsets of NLs whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity .
NL,natural language,EXT,"The purpose behind the development and implementation of a controlled NL typically is to aid non-native speakers of a NL in understanding it, or to ease computer processing of a NL."
NL,natural language,EXT,"An example of a widely used controlled NL is Simplified English, which was originally developed for aerospace industry maintenance manuals."
NL,natural language,EXT,Constructed international auxiliary languages such as Esperanto and Interlingua  are not generally considered NLs.
NL,natural language,EXT,"Natural languages have been used to communicate and have evolved in a natural way, whereas Esperanto was designed by L. L. Zamenhof selecting elements from NLs, not grown from natural fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax."
NL,natural language,EXT,"Some NLs have become naturally ""standardized"" by children's natural tendency to correct for illogical grammatical structures in their parents' speech, which can be seen in the development of pidgin languages into creole languages , but this is not the case in many languages, including constructed languages such as Esperanto, where strict rules are in place as an attempt to consciously remove such irregularities."

GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,Suppose it is desired to find the GCD of 48 and 180.
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,"If a and b are both nonzero, the GCD of a and b can be computed by using least common multiple  of a and b:"
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,The computational complexity of the computation of GCDs has been widely studied.
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,"If one uses the Euclidean algorithm and the elementary algorithms for multiplication and division, the computation of the GCD of two integers of at most n bits is 
  
    
      
        O"
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,"This means that the computation of GCD has, up to a constant factor, the same complexity as the multiplication."
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,"However, if a fast multiplication algorithm is used, one may modify the Euclidean algorithm for improving the complexity, but the computation of a GCD becomes slower than the multiplication."
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,"More precisely, if the multiplication of two integers of n bits takes a time of T, then the fastest known algorithm for GCD has a complexity 
  
    
      
        O"
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,The computation of the GCDs  belongs thus to the class of problems solvable in quasilinear time.
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,"This result was extended in 1987 to show that the probability that k random integers have GCD d is d−k/ζ.Using this information, the expected value of the GCD function can be seen  to not exist when k = 2."
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,"In commutative rings ==

The notion of GCD can more generally be defined for elements of an arbitrary commutative ring, although in general there need not exist one for every pair of elements."
GCD,greatest common divisor,EXT,"If d is a common divisor of a and b, and every common divisor of a and b divides d, then d is called a GCD of a and b.
With this definition, two elements a and b may very well have several GCDs, or none at all."

AE,autoencoder,EXT,An AE is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"The aim of an AE is to learn a representation  for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore signal “noise”."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Along with the reduction side, a reconstructing side is learnt, where the AE tries to generate from the reduced encoding a representation as close as possible to its original input, hence its name."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Examples are the regularized AEs , proven effective in learning representations for subsequent classification tasks, and Variational AEs, with their recent applications as generative models."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,An AE  is a neural network that learns to copy its input to its output.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Performing the copying task perfectly would simply duplicate the signal, and this is why AEs usually are restricted in ways that force them to reconstruct the input approximately, preserving only the most relevant aspects of the data in the copy."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"The idea of AEs has been popular in the field of neural networks for decades, and the first applications date back to the '80s."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Their most traditional application was dimensionality reduction or feature learning, but more recently the AE concept has become more widely used for learning generative models of data."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,Some of the most powerful AIs in the 2010s involved sparse AEs stacked inside of deep neural networks.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"The simplest form of an AE is a feedforward, non-recurrent neural network similar to single layer perceptrons that participate in multilayer perceptrons  – having an input layer, an output layer and one or more hidden layers connecting them – where the output layer has the same number of nodes  as the input layer, and with the purpose of reconstructing its inputs  instead of predicting the target value"
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Therefore, AEs are unsupervised learning models ."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"An AE consists of two parts, the encoder and the decoder, which can be defined as transitions"
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"In the simplest case, given one hidden layer, the encoder stage of an AE takes the input"
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"After that, the decoder stage of the AE maps"
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"As mentioned before, the training of an AE is performed through Backpropagation of the error, just like a regular feedforward neural network."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,This is the case of undercomplete AEs.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"If the hidden layers are larger than , or equal to, the input layer, or the hidden units are given enough capacity, an AE can potentially learn the identity function and become useless."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"However, experimental results have shown that AEs might still learn useful features in these cases."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"=== Regularized Autoencoders ===
Various techniques exist to prevent AEs from learning the identity function and to improve their ability to capture important information and learn richer representations."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,Sparse AE  ====
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Sparse AE may include more  hidden units than inputs, but only a small number of the hidden units are allowed to be active at once."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Specifically, a sparse AE is an AE whose training criterion involves a sparsity penalty"
AE,autoencoder,EXT,The k-sparse AE is based on a linear AE  and tied weights.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,Denoising AE  ====
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Differently from sparse AEs or undercomplete AEs that constrain representation, Denoising AEs  try to achieve a good representation by changing the reconstruction criterion."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"In practice, the objective of denoising AEs is that of cleaning the corrupted input, or denoising."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"{\tilde {x}}}}
   is then mapped to a hidden representation with the same process of the standard AE,"
AE,autoencoder,EXT,Contractive AE 
AE,autoencoder,EXT,Contractive AE adds an explicit regularizer in their objective function that forces the model to learn a function that is robust to slight variations of input values.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"There is a connection between the denoising AE  and the contractive AE : in the limit of small Gaussian input noise, DAE make the reconstruction function resist small but finite-sized perturbations of the input, while CAE make the extracted features resist infinitesimal perturbations of the input."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,Variational AE  =
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"AEs, Variational AEs  are generative models, like Generative Adversarial Networks."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Their association with this group of models derives mainly from the architectural affinity with the basic AE , but their mathematical formulation differs significantly."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"VAEs are directed probabilistic graphical models  whose posterior is approximated by a neural network, forming an AE-like architecture."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,Variational AE models make strong assumptions concerning the distribution of latent variables.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,The probability distribution of the latent vector of a VAE typically matches that of the training data much closer than a standard AE.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Experimentally, deep AEs yield better compression compared to shallow or linear AEs."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,Geoffrey Hinton developed a pretraining technique for training many-layered deep AEs.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"However, their experiments highlighted how the success of joint training for deep AE architectures depends heavily on the regularization strategies adopted in the modern variants of the model."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"The two main applications of AEs since the 80s have been dimensionality reduction and information retrieval, but modern variations of the basic model were proven successful when applied to different domains and tasks.


==="
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"Dimensionality Reduction was one of the first applications of deep learning, and one of the early motivations to study AEs."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"One milestone paper on the subject was that of Geoffrey Hinton with his publication in Science Magazine in 2006: in that study, he pretrained a multi-layer AE with a stack of RBMs and then used their weights to initialize a deep AE with gradually smaller hidden layers until a bottleneck of 30 neurons."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"====

If linear activations are used, or only a single sigmoid hidden layer, then the optimal solution to an AE is strongly related to principal component analysis ."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"The weights of an AE with a single hidden layer of size

AE,autoencoder,EXT,the output of the AE is an orthogonal projection onto this subspace.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"The AE weights are not equal to the principal components, and are generally not orthogonal, yet the principal components may be recovered from them using the singular value decomposition."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,Another field of application for AEs is anomaly detection.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"In most cases, only data with normal instances are used to train the AE; in others, the frequency of anomalies is so small compared to the whole population of observations, that its contribution to the representation learnt by the model could be ignored."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"After training, the AE will reconstruct normal data very well, while failing to do so with anomaly data which the AE has not encountered."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,The peculiar characteristics of AEs have rendered these model extremely useful in the processing of images for various tasks.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"One example can be found in lossy image compression task, where AEs demonstrated their potential by outperforming other approaches and being proven competitive against JPEG 2000.Another useful application of AEs in the field of image preprocessing is image denoising."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,"In the field of image-assisted diagnosis, there exist some experiments using AEs for the detection of breast cancer or even modelling the relation between the cognitive decline of Alzheimer's Disease and the latent features of an AE trained with MRILastly, other successful experiments have been carried out exploiting variations of the basic AE for image super-resolution tasks."
AE,autoencoder,EXT,In 2019 molecules generated with a special type of variational AEs were validated experimentally all the way into mice.
AE,autoencoder,EXT,In 2019 a variational AE framework was used to do population synthesis by approximating high-dimensional survey data.

BPP,bits per pixel,EXT,"Palettes were rarely used for depths greater than 12 BPP, as the memory consumed by the palette would exceed the necessary memory for direct color on every pixel."
BPP,bits per pixel,EXT,"Almost all cases of 32 BPP assigns 24 bits to the color, and the remaining 8 are the alpha channel or unused."

EP,entrance pupil,EXT,"If there is no lens in front of the aperture , the EP's location and size are identical to those of the aperture."
EP,entrance pupil,EXT,The EP is usually a virtual image: it lies behind the first optical surface of the system.
EP,entrance pupil,EXT,"The geometric location of the EP is the vertex of the camera's angle of view and consequently its center of perspective, perspective point, view point, projection centre or no-parallax point."

MV,mitral valve,EXT,"During left ventricular diastole, after the pressure drops in the left ventricle due to relaxation of the ventricular myocardium, the MV opens, and blood travels from the left atrium to the left ventricle."
MV,mitral valve,EXT,About 70 to 80% of the blood that travels across the MV occurs during the early filling phase of the left ventricle.
MV,mitral valve,EXT,"This early filling phase is due to active relaxation of the ventricular myocardium, causing a pressure gradient that allows a rapid flow of blood from the left atrium, across the MV."
MV,mitral valve,EXT,This early filling across the MV is seen on doppler echocardiography of the MV as the E wave.
MV,mitral valve,EXT,Left atrial contraction   causes added blood to flow across the MV immediately before left ventricular systole.
MV,mitral valve,EXT,This late flow across the open MV is seen on doppler echocardiography of the MV as the A wave.
MV,mitral valve,EXT,This reduction in annulus size at the end of atrial systole may be important for the proper coapting of the leaflets of the MV when the left ventricle contracts and pumps blood.

FAIR is an acronym for 'findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable', intended to more clearly define what is meant by the term 'OA' and make the concept easier to discuss."
OA,open access,EXT,Retention of copyright by authors can support academic freedoms by enabling greater control of the work  or licensing agreements .The most common licenses used in OA publishing are Creative Commons.

OA,open access,EXT,The premises behind OA publishing are that there are viable funding models to maintain traditional peer review standards of quality while also making the following changes:
OA,open access,EXT,An obvious advantage of OA journals is the free access to scientific papers regardless of affiliation with a subscribing library and improved access for the general public; this is especially true in developing countries.

QF,quadratic form,EXT,"When q assumes both positive and negative values, q is an indefinite QF."
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"The theorems of Jacobi and Sylvester show that any positive definite QF in n variables can be brought to the sum of n squares by a suitable invertible linear transformation: geometrically, there is only one positive definite real QF of every dimension."
QF,quadratic form,EXT,A QF over a field K is a map
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"More concretely, an n-ary QF over a field K is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2"
QF,quadratic form,EXT,Two n-ary QFs φ and ψ over K are equivalent if there exists a nonsingular linear transformation
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"The coefficient matrix A of q may be replaced by the symmetric matrix /2 with the same QF, so it may be assumed from the outset that A is symmetric."
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"Moreover, a symmetric matrix A is uniquely determined by the corresponding QF."
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"The associated bilinear form of a QF q is defined by

  
    
      
        
          b
          
            q"
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"Thus, bq is a symmetric bilinear form over K with matrix A. Conversely, any symmetric bilinear form b defines a QF"
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"As a consequence, over a field of characteristic not equal to 2, the theories of symmetric bilinear forms and of QFs in n variables are essentially the same."

QF,quadratic form,EXT,"The orthogonal group of a non-singular QF Q is the group of the linear automorphisms of V that preserve Q, that is, the group of isometries of  into itself."
QF,quadratic form,EXT,Every QF q
QF,quadratic form,EXT,Classification of all QFs up to equivalence can thus be reduced to the case of diagonal forms.
QF,quadratic form,EXT,Integral QFs ==
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"Quadratic forms over the ring of integers are called integral QFs, whereas the corresponding modules are quadratic lattices ."
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"An integral QF has integer coefficients, such as x2 + xy + y2; equivalently, given a lattice Λ in a vector space V , a QF Q is integral with respect to Λ if and only if it is integer-valued on Λ, meaning Q"
QF,quadratic form,EXT,Historically there was some confusion and controversy over whether the notion of integral QF should mean:
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"the QF associated to a symmetric matrix with integer coefficients
twos out
a polynomial with integer coefficients This debate"
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"was due to the confusion of QFs  and symmetric bilinear forms , and ""twos out"" is now the accepted convention; ""twos in"" is instead the theory of integral symmetric bilinear forms ."

QF,quadratic form,EXT,"Those include:

better understanding of the 2-adic theory of QFs, the 'local' source of the difficulty;
the lattice point of view, which was generally adopted by the experts in the arithmetic of QFs during the 1950s;
the actual needs for integral QF theory in topology for intersection theory;
the Lie group and algebraic group aspects."
QF,quadratic form,EXT,Universal QFs =
QF,quadratic form,EXT,An integral QF whose image consists of all the positive integers is sometimes called universal.
QF,quadratic form,EXT,"Recently, the 15 and 290 theorems have completely characterized universal integral QFs: if all coefficients are integers, then it represents all positive integers if and only if it represents all integers up through 290; if it has an integral matrix, it represents all positive integers if and only if it represents all integers up through 15."
