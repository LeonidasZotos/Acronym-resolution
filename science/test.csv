CT,chest tube,TS-3073,the purpose of this study was to test the safety and efficacy of a high vacuum pressure drainage system with a f double lumen CT methods included animal experiments where seven rabbits were subjected to BL tube thoracostomies using a f double lumen CT at torr on one side and more than torr on the other for T2 then a preliminary clinical study was done three patients were treated with a f double lumen chest tube and a vacuum box at torr T3 a thoracoscopic sympathectomy for approximately minutes an additional patients were treated with a conventional system using a f single lumen CT and chest drainage system at torr following the same operation all animals tolerated the test well suction injury of the lung was noted on the control side in the clinical T0 the air leaks stopped within minutes and no patients showed a radiologic sign of lung suction injury six patients in the control group developed subcutaneous emphysema in conclusion high vacuum pressure drainage of the chest using the f double lumen CT is safe and ERP
DT,developed tension,TS-3074,circumferential strips of rb aorta were subjected to second graded stretches in vitro before and T3 each stretch the vasoconstrictor doseresponses to potassium and norepinephrine were measured for stretch between to of resting length vasoconstrictor response was progressively enhanced however arteries stretched to of resting length showed a significant fall in DT in response to either vasoconstrictor since arteries in vivo operate at to of resting length due to physiologic distention it is likely that ERP angioplasty does induce paralysis of vascular smooth muscle
PA,polyacrylate,TS-3075,in soils impacted by mining activities a vegetal cover is required to protect the site from the erosive forces of water and wind the success of this objective depends on plant establishment and canopy closure polyacryalate polymers aid the growth of crops and indigenous plants in soils from sulfide mines soil characteristics NC as a consequence of polymer application but indicators that pinpoint these changes have not been identified yet our objectives were to identify the CS indicators of changes in soil SQ following polymer application relate these with assessment based on plant growth and soil cover a mine soil was left unamended or received a characterized PA a PA removed from diapers or shredded diapers biomass of spergularia purpurea was measured and proportion of soil cover evaluated soil enzymes microbial activity and QO2 were analyzed availability of potentially toxic trace elements was estimated by their concentration in shoots FA identified three factors that accounted for of the variation in parameters and the scores separated the four treatments the indicators with greatest communality were correlated with plant growth and soil cover the best soil quality indicators were as and zn in shoots protease Î²glucosidase and fructoseinduced QO2 it seems that the most important indicators to be used to assess the restoration of sulfide mine soils are those related with bioavailability of trace elements and soil enzymatic MICs
PR,pattern reversal,TS-3076,multifocal visual evoked potentials provide a topographic measure of visual response amplitude and RL the objective of this T0 was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the multifocal visual evoked potential technique in detecting visual abnormalities in patients with multiple sclerosis multifocal visual evoked potentials were recorded from patients with multiple sclerosis with PH of optic neuritis mson n eyes or without msnoon n eyes and normal subjects controls n eyes using a sector PR dartboard CS- veris amplitude and latency for each sector were compared with normative data and assigned probabilities size and location of clusters of adjacent abnormal sectors p were examined mean response amplitudes were se and for mson msnoon and control groups respectively with significant differences between all groups p mean latencies ms se relative to normative data were mson msnoon and controls group differences again significant p half the mson eyes had clusters larger than five sectors compared with in msnoon and in controls abnormal sectors were distributed diffusely although the largest cluster was smaller than sectors in twothirds of mson eyes cluster criteria combining amplitude and latency showed an area of under the receiver operating characteristic curve yielding a criterion with sensitivity and specificity we conclude that the multifocal visual evoked potential provides high sensitivity and specificity in detecting CA in visual function in multiple sclerosis patients
MM,methadone maintenance,TS-3077,although hepatitis c virus hcv is associated with SA treatment of addicts is problematic we report the results of a pilot scheme for treatment of hcv infected substance abusers in a MM center mmc
RS,rat serum,TS-3078,the effects of a week diet of butter or safflower oil as fat in combination with CS or soy protein as protein were observed for the SS concentrations of lipids and HFA compositions in rat serum and heart STC chol did not differ among the four exp diet groups in the butter CG significantly higher MDA-LDL ldlchol and lower highdensity lipoprotein hdlchol were observed than in the safflower oil CG p respectively higher levels of Î±tocopherol were found in the butter groups than in the safflower oil CG p and in the CS groups than in the soy protein CG p in comparison with the safflower oil CG the butter groups showed higher n polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa contents and lower n pufa contents in SS and the hearts p the ratios of nn pufa in the butter groups in SS and and in the hearts and buttercasein diet and buttersoy HP respectively were higher than those of the safflower oil CG of under in SS and and in the NF safflower oilcasein diet and safflower oilsoy protein diet respectively p in the soy protein CG higher n pufa contents in the NF were found than those of the CS CG p this study suggested that the butter diet induces higher C2 of n pufa and a higher nn pufa ratio than the safflower oil diet in RS and hearts over a long FF period
SS,supersaturation,TS-3079,polymeric micelles provide a promising platform for improving oral absorption of poorly soluble drugs however improved understanding of how drug retention within the hydrophobic micelle core can reduce drug absorption is required we designed supersaturated polymeric micelles superpms to increase molecularly dissolved drug concentration and gain an insight into the effect of the degree of SS on oral absorption of cyclosporine a csa in rats the drug release from superpms increased with an increase in initial SS degrees in micelles the cellular uptake of coumarin was reduced by the retention of drug in polymer micelles the transport flux of csa across caco ML was increased with initial supersaturation degrees of p however increase in SS to actually resulted in decreased csa transport the same trend was observed in a rat in vivo absorption study in which the highest bioavailability of Â± relative to a commercial product sandimmun neoralÂ® p was achieved when the SS degree was these results demonstrated that superpms were a promising drug delivery system for compounds with low AQ solubility this T0 also provided an exp proof for the hypothesis that moderately supersaturated formulations are valuable alternative to high SS formulations resulting in optimal in vivo performance and the degree of SS should be carefully controlled to optimize drug absorption
EB,energy balance,TS-3080,lifestyle AF have been linked to the risk of developing many common HM and increasingly to prognosis observational evidence has shown a relationship between socalled EB factors ie diet physical activity and body weight and risk of cancer recurrence and mortality in cancers of the breast prostate colon and perhaps other cancers interventional work has shown that individuals who make favorable changes in these lifestyle factors after CA diagnosis feel better experience less fatigue and may possibly even decrease risk of cancer recurrence other lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption have also been linked to the development of common cancers and may have important health consequences for cancer survivors this article reviews the evidence that links lifestyle factors to CA outcomes provides clinical recommendations for cancer survivors and describes future directions for lifestyle research in cancer survivors
ML,mycobacterium leprae,TS-3081,leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by ML characterized by a very long incubation period confounding signs and PS and difficulty to establish the onset time considering the stigma associated with the diagnosis and the difficulties in detecting asymptomatic leprosy the incidence and prevalence of this disease are underestimated in italy leprosy is currently included among the rare diseases and can occur as an imported pathology in native individuals or extraeu immigrants currently given its exceptional appearance in italy leprosy is extremely difficult to recognize in fact the incomplete knowledge by the medical class of geographical epidemiology and aetiology of tropical diseases including leprosy often delays the definitive diagnosis due to the increasing rate of the migration flows in italy and in europe leprosy should be considered among the differential diagnosis in patients with cutaneous and neurological signs especially when originating from endemic countries
PM,pleural mesothelioma,TS-3082,many common human cancer tissues express high C2 of FAS fas the primary enzyme for the synthesis of fatty acids and the differential expression of fas between normal and neoplastic tissues has led to the consideration of fas as a target for anticancer therapy to investigate the potential of targeting fas for the treatment of PM we first determined whether fas is overexpressed in human mesothelioma by immunohistochemistry we found of human mesothelioma tissue samples tested to express significantly increased C2 of fas compared with normal tissues including mesothelium to further explore fas as a therapeutic target in mesothelioma we established a nude mouse xenograft model for human mesothelioma using the hmeso cell line the ip xenografts of this cell line have high C2 of fas expression and fatty FAS pathway activity and grow along mesothelial surfaces in a manner similar to the growth DP of human mesothelioma growth of these RT xenografts was essentially abolished in mice treated with weekly ip i.v. of c a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of fas at levels that resulted in no significant systemic toxicity except for reversible weight loss these results suggest that fas may be an effective target for pharmacological therapy in a high proportion of human mesotheliomas
AV,aortic valve,TS-3083,with the wide application of rnaseq technology thousands of circular rnas circrnas have been identified in different type of tissues and cells in many organisms but little is known on the human aortic valve expressed circrnas in this study we identified all circrnas in two calcified human aortic valves and characterized the features of all circrnas a total of circrnas were identified in human aortic valves including AV TPS circrnas next we showed that most AV TPS circrnas were derived from the exonic regions of their host genes and majority of the host genes contained less than three circrnas to predict the potential CF of AV specific circrnas we performed the go gene ontology and kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analysis for the host genes and identified both microrna mirna and rna IB protein rbp binding CS inside AV specific circrnas results showed that these host genes were involved in some AV related CF pathways such as ecmreceptor interaction pathway erbb signaling pathway and V1 smooth muscle contraction pathway we also found that most aortic valve specific circrnas harbored abundant mirna response elements mres and some AV specific circrnas could bind to rbp of interest functional analysis suggested that these aortic valve TPS circrnas could act as posttranscriptional regulators
LOS,lipooligosaccharide,TS-3084,the increasing incidence and emergence of multidrug resistant mdr acinetobacter baumannii has become a L1 global health concern colistin is a historic antimicrobial that has become commonly used as a treatment for mdr a baumannii infections the increase in colistin usage has been mirrored by an increase in colistin resistance we aimed to identify the mechanisms associated with colistin resistance in a baumannii using multiple highthroughputsequencing technologies including transposondirected IS site sequencing tradis rna sequencing rnaseq and wholegenome sequencing wgs to investigate the genotypic changes of colistin resistance in a baumannii using tradis we found that genes involved in drug efflux adeijk and phospholipid mlac mlaf and mlad and LOS synthesis lpxc and lpso were required for survival in subinhibitory concentrations of colistin transcriptomic rnaseq analysis revealed that expression of genes encoding efflux proteins adei adec emrb mexb and macab was enhanced in in vitro generated colistinresistant strains wgs of these organisms identified disruptions in genes involved in lipid a lpxc and phospholipid synthesis mlaa and in the baesr twocomponent system tcs we additionally found that mutations in the pmrb tcs genes were the primary colistinresistanceassociated mechanisms in three vietnamese clinical colistinresistant a baumannii strains our results outline the entire range of mechanisms employed in a baumannii for resistance against colistin including drug extrusion and the loss of lipid a moieties by gene disruption or modification
PS,physiological saline,TS-3085,in order to maximize protein digestion the release of enzymes into the gut lumen is closely controlled by a regulatory loop cholecystokinin cck is among the enteric hormones that play a key role in the control of digestive enzyme secretion but its role in firstfeeding larvae is still unclear and may differ between species however in all marine fish larvae that have not developed a stomach by firstfeeding TR is the most important proteolytic enzyme in order to examine the regulation and FB mechanisms in the gut of larval cod we therefore studied the interactions between cholecystokinin and tryptic enzyme activity following the administration of solutions containing test substances directly into the gut we tubefed a single dose of PS solution containing either cck cck antagonist trypsin inhibitor phytohemagglutinin pha a possible trigger for the digestive response or physiological saline CT while a further control group was left UT we then followed the response in cck and tryptic enzyme activity for h after the administration we performed the experiment on larvae at day post firstfeeding which is before the stomach has evolved and the size of the larvae allows easier handling individual larvae were analyzed for cck and tryptic enzyme activity using radioimmunoassay and fluorimetric techniques respectively both factors varied over time in the untreated control group possibly due to an endogenous daily rhythm the higher cck C2 at h and h in the salineinjected group may be caused by reflexes initiated by distension of the gut an increase in tryptic enzyme activity T3 i.t. of cck supports the hypothesis that this hormone plays a part in the release of pancreatic enzymes in larval cod at this developmental stage however administration of a cck antagonist and a TR inhibitor did not reveal conclusive results probably due to the relatively low concentrations used the response in tryptic activity in the pha group was similar to the administration of cck pointing towards a stimulatory effect of pha on the proteolytic enzyme capacity of cod larvae
MI,metabolic inhibition,TS-3086,environmental concerns have been raised over the toxicity of crude NAs na originating from oil exploration MICs offshore oil sands exploitation onshore and use of refined na as wood preservatives tire additives and in various other applications the na exist in highly complex mixtures so the toxic effects of the individual acids are rarely known the present T0 investigated the relationships between the chemical structures of a range of synthetic alicyclic and aromatic acids and their acute toxicities both as single chemicals and as complex mixtures in a primary SC of rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss HCs the combined toxicity of multicomponent mixtures of these na was assessed using the concept of concentration addition ca and independent action ia prediction all of the acids tested were moderately toxic with ec values in the range Î¼m mg l and Î¼m mg l when assessed by effects on MI or loss of membrane integrity respectively binary and compound mixture of na caused combined toxicity according to the concept of additivity although slight dev biological tissues
HD,hip dysplasia,TS-3087,hip dysplasia is a common developmental problem affecting the canine population despite extensive research into the condition many questions remain unanswered and numerous misconceptions are present among the general public the purpose of this paper is to review the current knowledge on the development of hip dysplasia factors modifying its development and current diagnostic techniquesa computerized literature search was conducted for the period of january to april using the medline and cab databases and the keywords hip dysplasia hip dog and canine other articleswherever possible original research articles published before were also reviewed animals affected by hip dysplasia are born with normal hips but quickly develop subluxation of the FA head degenerative joint disease follows hip dysplasia is a complex inherited polygenic trait selective breeding of only normal dogs with nu/+ parents and grandparents is there commended method of reducing the incidence in the GA populationgene expression in affected individuals may be modified by a number of environmental AF these factors do not cause HD but they alter manifestations of the trait and its severity nutrition is a major environmental factor excess SE consumption increases the frequency and severity of hip dysplasia in genetically predisposed dogs FI should be regulated to maintain a slender figure with the ribs and dorsal vertebral spines easily palpable but not visible excess dietary calcium and vitamin d contribute to HD in genetically predisposed individuals and should be avoided high dose VC supplementation ingrowing puppies does not prevent HD and this practice should be discontinued animals must be years old before they can be certified as normal but the disease may be diagnosed earlier earlier diagnosis of the condition would be very useful for the selection of breeding stock but palpation techniques and the standard D2 view radiographs have unacceptably high rates of error in young puppies stress radiography techniques may improve the accuracy of early diagnosis in the future
AR,anaphylactoid reactions,TS-3088,traditional chinese medicine tcm has been used for prevention and treatment of various diseases for many decades tcm injection is a new dosage form with incidence of AR increasing every year in this study the rat basophilic one h rblh and laboratory of allergic disease lad dualmixedcmc was established and was coupled with an hplcesiittofms system to identify the potential allergenic components in haqing i.t. cinobufagin piperine osthole praeruptorin a and schizandrin a were screened from haqing i.t. via this coupled system competitive IB CA showed piperine praeruptorin a and schizandrin a acting on mrgprx and cinobufagin and osthole act on the ige receptor the release of mediators of anaphylaxis results showed cinobufagin and osthole can cause AR by triggering the release of Î²hexosaminidase and histamine via iger praeruptorin a and schizandrin a could promote the release of Î²hexosaminidase and histamine via mrgprx receptor in summary the dualmixedcmc MM can significantly improve the efficiency of target component identification from a complex sample when combined with competitive binding assay and validation of biological activities this MM enables accurate determination of the dualtarget components offering improved methods for quality control of tcm injections
IS,isotonic saline,TS-3089,the organisation of LT care for older people has L1 implications for all hospital and community health services however even health professionals have a poor understanding of the structure and purpose of LT care and national professional HB are still not giving enough attention to the issues involved in the wider context care of disabled older people has received little public debate in the uk despite the ethical social and financial issues involved and despite the recent L1 organisational changes in the health service the past ten years have seen a huge expansion in private residential and nursing homes with a concomitant fall in nhs longstay beds currently approximately elderly people in the uk are living in some form of longstay care facility and many other elderly people with multiple disabilities are being supported at home and should also be included under the umbrella of longterm care ensuring AGA equitable and highquality care is a responsibility not only for health and social services but also for society as a whole thisby placing pairs of tiny mercury droplets on the epithelial surface and on the endothelial surface of the cornea a distance of mm could be determined with a standard deviation of micron central corneal radius of curvature was measured from digital traces of the corneal surface contour the sigma on estimating the radius of an mm steel sphere was microns CT was measured by digital optical pachometry the standard deviation on measuring a thickness of mm was microns the corneal extensibility was investigated in a total of enucleated human eyes with increased corneal hydration tension was applied by varying the intraocular pressure from to mmhg with a column of IS the epithelial side corneal CS and the increase in corneal curvature were approximately for a NC in intraocular pressure from to mmhg when a high intraocular pressure was kept constant for h the CT radius of curvature and the epithelial side CS gradually decreased whereas the EC side strain increased the elastic and viscoelastic behaviour of the human cornea was found to be closely related to changes in corneal hydration we found DIP useful for in vitro biomechanical studies of the cornea
LB,langmuirblodgett,TS-3090,we have studied films of an ionic discogenic discotic mesogenic molecule pyridinium salt tethered with hexaalkoxytriphenylene pytp and dna complex at airwater aw and airsolid interfaces we have formed an pytp ML on an aqueous subphase containing a small amount of dna to obtain a pytpdna complex at the aw interface compared to the pure pytp monolayer the pytpdna complex ML exhibits a higher collapse pressure and lower limiting area indicating condensation and better stability a brewster angle microscope was used for in situ observation of the morphology of the film at the aw interface the pytpdna complex films on Si wafers were prepared using the LB lb technique we find that several tens of layers of the pytpdna complex ML can be transferred with good efficiency fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies confirm the presence of dna in the lb films of the pytpdna complex nanoindentation measurements using atomic force microscope reveal that the pytpdna complex films are about two times harder as compared to the pure pytp films
ICC,immunocytochemical,TS-3091,expression of the cfyn protooncogene was analysed in the developing and adult rat BB by subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry using polyclonal antibodies specific for its protein product pfyn immunoperoxidase staining revealed widespread localization of pfyn in developing axonal tracts throughout the fetal e rat brain fyn immunoreactivity was not observed in most axonrich regions of the adult BB but continued to be expressed at elevated levels in the adult olfactory and vomeronasal systems at other sites in the adult rat BB fyn immunoreactivity was restricted to cell bodies of neuronal subpopulations especially those in brain stem and Thy nuclei and to subpopulations of glial cells along axonal tracts in the medulla optic nerve and WG matter of the spinal cord in the peripheral nervous system fyn staining was also prominent in SCs subcellular fractionation of fetal and adult rat brain confirmed the ICC localization demonstrating an enrichment of pfyn in CM from a fetal brain fraction containing nerve growth cones and lower C2 in adult BB where there was only a small enrichment in synaptosomal CM the developmental regulation of pfyn suggests that the fyn tyrosine kinase may serve separate cellular roles in axonal growth and specialized functions of mature SN and glia
MV,microvilli,TS-3092,poxviruses are among the largest and most complex viruses known vaccinia virus the prototype of the family poxviridae has been studied much more than myxoma virus the aim of this work was to have a better knowledge about myxoma virus morphogenesis the characterization of the main stages of mv morphogenesis was achieved by ultrastructural and immunological analysis specific antibodies were raised against ml and ml two env proteins of extracellular enveloped virus and intracellular mature virus respectively the main stages of assembly were similar to those seen with other poxviruses and the duration of the whole replication cycle was estimated to be around h longer than what was described for vaccinia virus morphological changes of INF cells were associated with the development of long cellular projections and enlarged MV intracellular enveloped viruses are associated with the cytoskeleton to move through the cell unlike earlier studies as many cellassociated enveloped viruses as intracellular enveloped viruses were observed in relation with specialized MV although these structures were rarely noticed finally an unusual spreading process was observed which uses cytoplasmic corridors
NB,nitrobenzene,TS-3093,microcystinlr mclr is the most common cyanotoxin in contaminated aquatic systems mclr inhibits protein phosphatases and a leading to liver damage and tumor formation mclr is relatively SD owing to its cyclic structures the combined uvho technology can degrade mclr efficiently the secondorder rate constant of the reaction between mclr and hydroxyl radical Â·oh is Â±Ã\x97 m s based on the competition kinetics model using NB as reference compound the probable degradation pathway was analyzed through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry results suggested that the major destruction pathways of mclr were initiated by Â·oh attack on the BZ ring and diene of the adda side chain the corresponding aldehyde or ketone peptide residues were formed through further oxidation another minor destruction pathway involved Â·oh attack on the methoxy group of the adda side chain followed by CR removal of the methoxy group the combined uvho system is a promising technology for mclr removal in contaminated aquatic systems
TP,transit peptide,TS-3094,for the first time a method is described in which an NT targeting peptide is isolated from escherichia coli T3 overexpression purification and cleavage of a FP the proteasesensitive TP from the cp precursor protein preferredoxin could be isolated by hplc it was characterized by nterminal amino acid sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry its functionality was suggested by in vitro import competition experiments with isolated pea chloroplasts in which the isolated peptide inhibited the import of radioactively labeled preferredoxin results from import competition experiments performed with a TP deletion mutant suggested that the four extreme CT amino acids lack information to interact with the cp import machinery
LM,listeria monocytogenes,TS-3095,we report the case of a pregnant woman with listeriosis at gestational weeks followed by premature labor at gestational weeks BM was suspected in the neonate with ventriculitis on sonography a high level of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid csf and an identified specific bacterial genome of LM pcr s rdna and sequencing and specific amplification of l monocytogenes hly gene in csf neonatal meningitis was complicated with CBF venous sinus thrombosis and ventriculomegaly listeriosis during pregnancy can lead to severe complications in the neonate thus listeriosis should be a diagnostic concern in febrile pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy firstline treatment is based on highdose amoxicillin or gday and must be used for at least weeks for treatment of listeriosis during pregnancy if the fetus survives longer therapy until delivery can be discussed
LC,liver cirrhosis,TS-3096,there is a jshaped rho between the amount of alcohol consumed per day and overall mortality risk and an inverse rho between the amount of alcohol consumed per day and cardiovascular mortality the evidence is stronger for men than for women the correlations are independent of the type of alcoholic beverage predominantly consumed possible mechanisms explaining the cardioprotective antiatherosclerotic effects of moderate alcohol consumption are inhibition of platelet aggregation increase in serum high density lipoprotein hdl C2 and prevention of diabetes mellitus the two latter mechanisms can also explain a delayed progression of atherosclerosis due to alcohol consumption the beneficial effects are counteracted by detrimental effects of alcohol on the incidence of CA diseases LC violence and accidents therefore alcohol consumption in general cannot be recommended for prevention of cardiovascular diseases
MD,moderate disability,TS-3097,annual retrospective surveys of to medical centers performing endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms in japan from to were performed to analyze technical and clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment for ruptured CBF aneurysm patients treated with dome embolization using bare platinum coils within days T3 ON were retrospectively selected and clinical features and technical and clinical outcomes at discharge were studied retrospective endovascular subarachnoid aneurysm treatment resat covers patients treated from when the guglielmi detachable coil was introduced to just T3 international subarachnoid aneurysm trial was reported resat to resat were conducted annually between and among patients with ruptured aneurysms treated within days after onset patients were treated by dome embolization using Pt detachable coils the patients in this C1 retrospective survey included aged over years with posterior circulation aneurysms and with poor grades hunt and kosnik grades iv and v the proportion of patients aged over years tended to increase each year from in resat to in resat and the proportion of those with posterior circulation aneurysms decreased from in resat to in resat p overall technical success was obtained in patients and favorable clinical outcome good REC and MD at discharge was obtained in of grade iiii cases and of grade iv cases procedurerelated morbidity was and mortality was despite this survey involving high proportions of aged posterior circulation and poorgrade patients the technical success rate and immediate clinical results were relatively favorable the patient prognosis and aneurysm changes must be investigated over a longer period together with the effects of the introduction of new endovascular devices for CBF aneurysms
RPE,perceived exertion,TS-3098,to investigate the impact of highintensity walking training hiwt on prefrail and frail older adults five assisted living residents underwent a supervised session intervention the intervention consisted of min of hiwt at of heart rate reserve or ratings of to hard to very hard on the borg rating of RPE scale training included walking at fast speeds multidirections stairs and outdoor surfaces with and without an assistive device training significantly reduced frailty using the sharefi p increased fast gait speed p improved min walk test distance p and enhanced BBS scores p there were no AEs and all participants reached target training intensity in all sessions participants viewed the walking MI as highly satisfactory on a likert scale and recommended that the AL facility should offer hiwt as part of routine programming
FS,field stimulation,TS-3099,hyperoxic SE enhances AR in P0 animals possibly due to altered relaxation we sought to define the role of prostaglandinand nitric oxidemediated mechanisms in impaired airway relaxation induced by hyperoxic stress we exposed dayold rat pups to either room air or hyperoxia o for days to assess airway EC50 and camp and cgmp production T3 electrical FS efs efsinduced relaxation of preconstricted tr was diminished in hyperoxic vs normoxic animals p indomethacin a cyclooxygenase inhibitor reduced efsinduced airway relaxation in tracheae from normoxic p but not hyperoxic rat pups however in the presence of ngnitrolarginine methyl ester a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor efsinduced airway EC50 was similarly decreased in tracheae from both normoxic and hyperoxic animals after efs the increase from baseline in the production of camp was significantly higher in tracheae from normoxic than hyperoxic rat pups and this was accompanied by greater prostaglandin e PR only in the normoxic group cgmp production after efs stimulation did not differ between normoxic and hyperoxic CG we conclude that hyperoxia impairs airway relaxation in immature animals via a mechanism helves used for storing the cytotoxic drugs was also wipe sampled and the disposable gloves worn while wiping the vials for each drug were also analysed a significant number of vials had a quantifiable level of external contamination C2 of contamination up to ngvial were found C2 of glove and floor contamination for some drugs were found to be comparable with values found in our study of the clean rooms where the isolators were situated and the pharmacy staff prepared the cytotoxic drugs
BP,biphenyl,TS-3100,bioactivation of carcinogens by peroxidases has received increasing attention since the discovery of the oxidation of carcinogens by prostaglandin hydroperoxidase benzidine and tetramethylbenzidine are oxidized by horseradish peroxidase and prostaglandin synthase to twoelectron oxidation products diimines diimines readily react with the phenolic antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole to form adducts in this paper we have studied the oxidation of benzidine by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of phenolic compounds and characterized the resultant benzidinephenol adducts a benzidinedimethylphenol adduct was isolated and characterized by mass spectrometry and high field nmr the reaction of cbenzidine in the presence of horseradish peroxidase and phenol yielded only the benzidinephenol adduct our results indicate that the benzidinephenol adducts are analogous to the indoaniline dyes differing only in substitution of a BP group for a benzene ring the reaction of benzidine diimine with endogenous phenols may represent a new pathway for detoxication removing potentially harmful metabolites of benzidine
IPS,intraparietal sulcus,TS-3101,severe and moderate traumatic BB injury stbi often results in LT cognitive deficits such as reduced processing speed and attention the IPS ips is a neocortical structure that plays a crucial role in the deeply interrelated processes of multisensory processing and top down attention therefore we hypothesized that disruptions in the functional and structural connections of the ips may play a role in the development of such deficits to examine these connections we used resting state magnetic resonance imaging rsfmri and diffusion kurtosis imaging dki in a cohort of patients with stbi Â± years and control participants Â± years participants were prospectively recruited and received rsfmri and neuropsychological assessments including the automated NP assessment metrics anam at greater than months postinjury a subset of participants received a dki scan results suggest that patients with stbi performed worse than control participants on multiple subtests of the anam suggesting reduced cognitive performance reduced resting state PET connectivity between the ips and cortical regions associated with multisensory processing and the dorsal attention network was observed in the patients with stbi the patients also showed reduced structural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus slf a key VWM tract connecting the ips to anterior FC areas as measured by reduced mean kurtosis mk and fractional anisotropy fa and increased mean diffusivity md further this reduced structural integrity of the slf was associated with a reduction in overall cognitive performance these findings suggest that disruptions in the structural and functional connectivity of the ips may contribute to chronic cognitive deficits experienced by these patients
RPE,retinal pigment epithelium,TS-3102,we examined the effects of the antioxidant enzymes ukg of superoxide dismutase sod and ukg of catalase cat on cat electroretinograms during the reperfusion after retinal ischemia the intravenous administrations of sod and cat promoted the REC of the cwave after min of ischemia but not the bwave at min after ON of reperfusion sod and cattreated eyes showed and recovery of the cwave amplitude respectively against REC in the UT eyes these results suggested that the oxygenderived free radicals affected the RPE at the early period of reperfusion
DL,dichotic listening,TS-3103,this experiment tested two hypotheses linking RA CBF arousal to hostility and physiological arousal a replication of previous research supporting heightened physiological systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure and HR rate CR among highhostility subjects was partially successful hemispheric lateralization of CBF activity in response to stress was also measured low and highhostility subjects were identified using the Ho scale cmhs physiological measures systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded and DL procedures were po before and C2 of the coldpressor paradigm the primary finding of this research was greater right cerebral activation to AS among highhostility subjects as indicated by their enhanced ability to identify syllables presented to the LE data further supported previous findings of heightened physiological reactivity to stress among highhostility subjects and suggest a positive relationship between RA CBF activity and cardiovascular arousal
RP,regulatory particle,TS-3104,the proteasome is a sophisticated atpdependent molecular machine responsible for protein Kd in all known eukaryotic cells it remains elusive how conformational changes of the aaaatpase unfoldase in the RP rp control the gating of the substratetranslocation channel leading to the proteolytic chamber of the core particle cp here we report three alternative states of the atpÎ³sbound human proteasome in which the cp gates are asymmetrically open visualized by cryoem at nearatomic resolutions at least four nucleotides are bound to the aaaatpase ring in these opengate states R2 in nucleotide IB gives rise to an axial movement of the pore loops narrowing the substratetranslation channel which exhibit remarkable structural EMT between the spiralstaircase and saddleshapedcircle topologies gate opening in the cp is thus regulated by nucleotidedriven conformational changes of the aaaatpase unfoldase these findings demonstrate an elegant mechanism of allosteric coordination among submachines within the human proteasome holoenzyme
RT,room temperature,TS-3105,it is shown by means of AUC that skeletal S1 s exists in the form of a monomerdimer mixture in rapid reversible equilibrium sensitive to the hydrostatic pressure the temperature and the composition of the buffer at least ph ionic strength presence or absence of a mgphosphate compound and presence or absence of mg the dimer is predominant at high ph at low ionic strength in the presence of a mgphosphate compound at OHP and at low temperature the monomer is predominant in the reverse conditions at atmospheric pressure and at RT in a buffer having a composition close to that of the physiological medium but containing no mgphosphate compound the monomer is largely predominant more than at mgml s at atmospheric pressure and at room temperature in a buffer containing a mgphosphate compound and having a composition close to that of the physiological medium s exists in the form of a monomerdimer mixture with a noticeable proportion of dimer more than at mgml s in the presence of mm mgadp and mm mg in such buffers the monomerdimer ratio is extremely sensitive to both the ph and the ionic strength the sedimentation coefficients of the monomer and the dimer are respectively s and s the two protomers making up the dimer are stuck together in an endtoend arrangement both the monomer and the dimer are highly hydrated about g of waterg of protein for the monomer and probably more for the dimer
LP,late proximal,TS-3106,excessive circulating fat levels are a defining feature of poor metabolic control in diabetes splanchnic adipose tissue is a source of free fatty acids ffa and the liver is a key site of ffa utilization and the sole source of ketones despite the role of splanchnic tissues in fat metabolism little is known about how these tissues respond to diabetes under divergent metabolic conditions therefore splanchnic fat metabolism was studied in poorly controlled diabetes under two conditions first it was studied during exercise a stimulus that enhances ffa flux second it was studied while insulin was being acutely infused to achieve C2 normally present during exercise a treatment that may be expected to inhibit lipolysis for this purpose CL and gut arteriovenous differences were used during rest and h of treadmill exercise in insulindeficient n and acutely insulininfused n depancreatized px dogs the data show that exercise in insulindeficient px dogs leads to an increase in net ffa release from mesenteric fat that is equal in magnitude to the response in nondiabetic dogs net hepatiavily on the measurements of sngfr which are feasible only in animals the measurement of sngfr by collection of total tubular fluid may be influenced by the fall in intratubular HP that may reflect the negative pressure applied to the sampling pipette this effect may become more important with shortening of the distance between the sampling site and the bowman space we analysed this putative effect by performing collections of total tubular fluid from the LP lp and then from the early proximal ep segment of the same nephrons in paired collections lpsngfr averaged sem nl x min and was no different from the paired mean epsngfr of sem nl x min p then ep and lp sngfr were significantly correlated r p as expected the respective paired means of absolute and percentage reabsorptions and those of collection rates were significantly different the average sngfr computed from each lp and ep paired measurement was significantly correlated with the simultaneously measured kidney glomerular filtration rate gfr r p the ratio of gfr to sngfr indicated the expected number of glomeruli these data would indicate that the sampling site does not influence the measurement of sngfr in the proximal tubule when the total fluid collection technique is correctly performed they also exclude a timedependent activation of the macula densa capable of upregulating sngfr within the interval elapsing between the beginning of lp and the completion of ep collections which in our T0 averaged sem min
LP,lateral posterior,TS-3107,we have studied the normal organization of the hamster LP nucleus and its reorganization T3 neonatal superior colliculus lesions first we divided the LP nucleus into rostrolateral rostromedial and caudal subdivisions and determined the normal distributions of terminals contributed to each division by the ipsilateral and contralateral superior colliculi the ipsilateral posterior neocortex and the contralateral retina since the rostrolateral subdivision receives most of the projections from the ipsilateral superior colliculus our studies concentrated on this region the rostrolateral subdivision contains synaptic clusters formed primarily by mediumsized mterminals synapsing around a central dendrite electron microscopic observations showed that the majority of mterminals are from the ipsilateral colliculus although a few are contributed by the contralateral colliculus and retina therefore after an ipsilateral neonatal colliculus lesion the synaptic clusters must develop in the absence of their major input the next step was to examine the distributions of the remaining afferents to the rostrolateral subdivision in adult animals which had received ipsilateral neonatal colliculus lesions in the cases the normally restricted projection fields of the CL colliculus and the retina expand until they share a border in the rostrolateral subdivision in contrast the cortical projection which normally extends throughout the LP is reduced in the region containing retinal terminals at the ultrastructural level we found morpholes mouse bfl melanoma and human HS melanoma were examined for their abilities to adhere to confluent VE cell monolayers and to the underlying EC extracellular matrix tumor cells attacked slowly to the EC cell monolayers while they adhered rapidly to isolated EM when analyzed by PAGE in sodium dodecylsulfate solutions the extracellular matrix was shown to be primarily composed of a protein of identical migration and molecular weight to fibronectin tumorcell adhesion to fibronectincoated polyvinyl surfaces mimicked the rapid rate of attachment of RT cells to EM and RT cells adherent to either EM or fibronectincoated polyvinyl dishes adopted an unusual highly spread and flattened morphology with numerous small projections these results suggest that fibronectin associated with the endothelial basement membrane may be in part responsible for establishing an adhesive gradient that could be important in malignant cell extravasation
CBP,chronic bacterial prostatitis,TS-3108,patients with chronic prostatitispelvic pain syndrome typically report genital or pelvic pain in or around the penis perineum scrotum lasting months whereas true CBP is an uncommon condition characterised by recurrent prostatic and urinary infection chronic pelvic pain syndrome cpps is a common condition in which no infection is found recent surveys suggest a prevalence of for cpps the fourglass test traditionally used to distinguish inflammatory and inflammatory forms of cpps has not been adequately validated whether the distinction is clinically meaningful is increasingly questioned the aetiology of cpps is not known urodynamic studies imply a neuromuscular origin more recent work supports a role for Th1 cytokines in the pathogenesis in the management of chronic bacterial prostatitis trials support the use of quinolone antibiotics as firstline treatment in contrast the management of cpps is generally unsatisfactory as no reliable treatment has been identified treatments commonly tried include antibiotics notably tetracyclines quinolones and macrolides antiinflammatory agents and alpha blockers newer approaches include trials of finasteride quercetin and rofecoxib a recent SR demonstrated that none of the current diagnostic and treatment methods for cpps is supported by a robust evidence base
AT,adipose tissue,TS-3109,the effects of hyperinsulinaemia imposed on normal rats on the subsequent insulinresponsiveness in vivo of deoxydglucose uptake of white adipose tissue and of various muscle types were investigated this was done by treating normal rats with insulin via osmotic minipumps and by comparing them with salineinfused controls hyperinsulinaemia produced by prior insulin treatment resulted in a welltolerated hypoglycaemia at the end of the treatment the gl utilization index of individual tissues was determined by euglycaemichyperinsulinaemic clamps associated with the labelled deoxydglucose method prior insulin treatment resulted in increased insulinresponsiveness of the glucose utilization index of WG AT and in increased total lipogenesis in white adipose tissue and fatpad weight in contrast prior insulin treatment resulted in a decreased gl utilization index of several muscles these opposite effects of hyperinsulinaemia on glucose utilization in WG AT and muscles persisted when the hypoglycaemiainduced catecholamine SO was prevented adrenomedullectomy propranolol treatment as well as when hypoglycaemia was normalized by concomitant insulin treatment and glucose infusion insulin suppressed hepatic glucose production during the clamps in insulintreated rats as in the respective controls whereas total hepatic lipid synthesis and CL fat content were greater in rats treated with insulin than in controls it is concluded that hyperinsulinaemia itself could be one of the driving forces responsible for producing increased glucose utilization by white AT increased total lipid synthesis with fat accumulation in AT and the CL together with an insulinresistant state at the muscular level
SD,solid dispersion,TS-3110,with the increase concern of solubilization for insoluble drug ternary SD sd formulations developed more rapidly than binary systems however rational formulation design of ternary systems and their dissolution molecular mechanism were still under development current research aimed to develop the ERP ternary formulations and investigate their molecular mechanism by integrated experimental and modeling techniques glipizide gli was selected as the MM drug and peg was used as the solubilizing polymer while surfactants eg sds or tween were the third components sd samples were prepared at different weight ratio by melting method in the dissolution tests the CMS effect of ternary system with very small amount of surfactant drugpegsurfactant was similar with that of binary systems with high polymer ratios drugpeg and the molecular structure of ternary systems was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry dsc infrared absorption spectroscopy ir xray diffraction xrd and SEM microscope sem moreover molecular dynamic md simulations mimicked the preparation process of sds and molecular motion in solvent revealed the dissolution mechanism of sd as the gordontaylor equation described the exp and calculated values of tg were compared for ternary and binary systems which confirmed good miscibility of gli with other components in summary ternary sd systems could significantly decrease the usage of polymers than binary sls in the recipients receiving cd t cells expressed cd and the cells had lower levels of il and tgfÎ² mrna thus our results connect the cd haplotypedependent protection from td to an antidiabetogenic CF of cdexpressing tregs and grpositive myeloid cells and confirm the identity of cd as idd

ML,midluteal,TS-3112,the primary limiting factor for effective ivf treatment is successful embryo implantation recurrent implantation failure rif is a condition whereby couples fail to achieve pregnancy despite consecutive embryo transfers here we describe the collection of gene expression profiles from ML phase endometrial biopsies n from women experiencing rif and HCs using a signature discovery set n we identify a signature containing genes predictive of rif independent validation in samples shows that the gene signature predicts rif with positive predictive value ppv the strength of the rif associated expression signature also stratifies rif patients into distinct CG with different subsequent implantation success rates exploration of the expression changes suggests that rif is primarily associated with reduced cellular proliferation the gene signature nvestigated utilizing a lossoffunction exp setting in a vast collection of genetically varied melanoma cell lines we observed the requirement of ranbp in melanoma cell proliferation and survival mechanistically we suggest the reinstatement of transforming growth factorÎ² tgfÎ²smadpcip tumorsuppressor axis as part of the ranbp silencingassociated antiproliferative program employing extensive nuclear export sequence analyses and immunofluorescencebased protein localization studies we further present evidence suggesting the requirement of ranbp CF for the nuclear exit of the weak nuclear export sequenceharboring extracellular signalregulated kinase protein although it is dispensable for GA crmmediated nuclear export of strong nuclear export sequenceharboring cargoes rendering mechanistic support to ranbp silencingmediated apoptosis consequent to ERK kinase nuclear entrapment we observed increased C2 of cytoplasmically restricted nonphosphorylatedactive proapoptotic bclantagonist of cell death bad protein last we present evidence suggesting the frequently activated MAP kinase signaling in melanoma as a potential founding basis for a deregulated posttranslational control of ranbp activity collectively the presented data suggest ranbp as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in human melanoma
SI,situs inversus,TS-3113,situs inversus of the ABD organs in the presence of normally placed HR on the left side of the thorax is known as situs inversus with isolated levocardia this rare condition is commonly associated with severe congenital defects of the heart we report a case of situs inversus with levocardia in a yearold asymptomatic male patient with completely normal heart on the left chest SCT of the thorax and abdomen and echocardiographic studies revealed SI of ABD organs normal HR levocardia mirrored left lungs a midline CL a leftsided IVC connecting to the right atrium multiple splenic masses in the abdominal right upper quadrant and aneurysmal dilatation of a SA
CP,cricopharyngeal,TS-3114,twelve patients underwent endoscopic i.v. of botulinum toxin type a in the cricopharyngeus muscle for the treatment of dysphagia and CP spasm over a year period the patients charts were reviewed preoperative and postoperative symptoms examination and swallowing studies were reviewed eleven of the patients had improvement in their symptoms which lasted for a mean of months two patients elected cricopharyngeal myotomy for permanent correction of their dysphagia there was case of postoperative neck cellulitis in an immunocompromised patient undergoing simultaneous excision of a thyroglossal duct cyst we conclude that endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin is a relatively safe and viable technique for the treatment of dysphagia associated with CP spasm it requires simple tools readily available to otolaryngologists larger prospective controlled studies are necessary to establish its effectiveness and role in the management of this condition
FPR,formyl peptide receptor,TS-3115,cancer cells recruit monocytes macrophages and other inflammatory cells by producing abundant chemoattractants and growth AF such as macrophage colonystimulating factor mcsfcsf and mo chemoattractant protein mcpccl to promote tumor growth and dissemination an understanding of the mechanisms that target CA cells and regulate RT microenvironment is essential in designing anticancer therapies here we showed that SS amyloida saa and cathelicidin ll stimulated mcsf and mcp expression with or without lipopolysaccharide lps administration conversely lipoxina lxa and annexina anxa inhibited lpsinduced mcsf and mcp production by human hepg and mouse h hepatocellular carcinoma cells hccs the effects of lxa anxa saa and ll were dependent on the activation of their mutual cellsurface receptor FPR fpr and subsequent rosmapknfkb signalings furthermore our results indicated that lps switched macrophages into an illowilhigh m profile whereas mcsfmcp and fpr agonists skewed them into m ilhighillow in that respect through modulating the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription stat lxa and anxa induced monocyte differentiation into mamclike cells and showed antitumorigenetic activities whereas saa ll and mcsfmcp led to mb or mdlike polarization which exacerbated hcc invasion in vitro and in vivo respectively our results suggest that fpr has an appreciable pleiotropic regulator role in tumor immunoediting
ES,electrically stimulated,TS-3116,to determine whether chromosomes in the porcine first PB pb can complete the second meiotic division and subsequently undergo normal preimplantation embryonic development we examined the developmental competence of pb chromosomes injected into enucleated mii stage oocytes by NT method chromosome replacement group cr group after parthenogenetic activation pa or in vitro fertilization ivf the cleavage rate of reconstructed oocytes in the ivf group crivf group Â± and pa group crpa group Â± were significantly lower than that of control groups in which normal mii oocytes were subjected to ivf miiivf group Â± and pa miipa group Â± unfertilized rates was significantly higher in the crivf group Â± than in the miiivf group Â± the blastocyst formation rate was Â± in the crpa group whereas no blastocyst formation was observed in the crivf group to produce tetraploid parthenogenetic embryos IN mii stage oocytes injected with pb chromosomes were ES treated with Î¼gml cytochalasin b for h mii oocyte pb cb group and then cultured without cytochalasin b the average cleavage rate of reconstructed oocytes was of and the blastocyst formation rate was of chromosome analysis showed similar proportions of haploid and diploid cells in the control normal mii oocytes and cr groups T3 pa overall of blastocysts were tetraploid in the mii oocyte pb cb group these results demonstrate that chromosomes in pb can participate in normal preimplantation embryonic development when injected into enucleated mii stage oocytes and that tetraploid pa blastocysts are produced although at a low proportion when pb chromosomes are injected into IN mii stage oocytes
TS,thermostable,TS-3117,two TS Î±carbonic anhydrases Î±cas isolated from thermophilic sulfurihydrogenibium spp namely sspca from s yellowstonensis and sazca from s azorense were shown in a previous work to possess interesting cDNA properties sspca was shown to have an exceptional thermal stability whereas sazca demonstrated to be the most active Î±ca known to date for the co hydration reaction here we report the crystallographic structure of sazca and the identification of the structural features responsible for its high catalytic activity by comparing it with sspca structure these data are of relevance for the design of engineered proteins showing higher stability and catalytic activity than other Î±cas known to date
TM,thrombotic microangiopathy,TS-3118,thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemias include thrombotic TP ttp HUS hus and pregnancy associated TM tma eight AD patients four males and four females with tma who were treated between and at the hospital italiano de buenos aires were reviewed the average age was clinical diagnosis of tma was made on admission in four patients during their stay in hospital patients developed hus characteristics three as ttp and one presented pregnancy associated tma all of them revealed TP and microangiophatic hemolytic anemia renal impairment was the third most frequent characteristic at presentation the patients with ttp revealed the most severe condition all patients received daily plasma exchange immunosuppressants were also used four patients recovered completely passed away one remains with renal impairment and requires hemodialysis and a colectomy was performed on one of them the tma syndromes are occlusive disorders associated to PLT microvascular thrombi SVR and renal circulations are primarily affected ttphus might represent an overlapping spectrum of idiopathic or AA disease prompt recognition and treatment are vital because high mortality occurs due to these disorders among the differential diagnosis of tma we can refer to sepsis neoplasms systemic vasculitis eclampsia and others the mainstay treatments are daily plasma exchange and infusion with fresh frozen plasma improving the management of these diseases is required considering their high morbidity and mortality
PE,pulmonary embolus,TS-3119,deep VT dvt tends to occur in greater frequency among cyclosporine csatreated renaltransplant recipients because administration of sirolimus may increase the wholeblood concentrations of csa we sought to assess the impact of the combination regimen on the incidence predisposing AF and consequences of postoperative dvt SPK renalvein or artery thrombosis and PE
MR,methicillinresistant,TS-3120,during the past years a considerable number of known and new xanthones from the calophyllum species of sri lanka have been isolated and characterized we have investigated the antimicrobial activity of calophyllum xanthones with a special reference to MRSA mrsa these activity studies were carried out using the agar plate method calozeloxanthone a xanthone which has been isolated from c moonii and c lankensis showed the highest activity against MR s aureus mrsa strains at a concentration of microgml hence calozeyloxanthone appears to hold promise as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of infections with s aureus including MSSA mrsa and should be investigated further
PE,prolonged exposure,TS-3121,previous work has shown that ST exposure of cats to oxygen at OHP ohp to the extent of overt convulsive seizures has little or no effect on the lung appearance or lung weight but does alter the alveolar surfactants more PE results in hemorrhagic edema of the cat lung similar to that observed in rats T3 only ST SE previous work showed that sympathetic stimulation via the stellate ganglion and mechanical cns injury results in altered surfactants attributed to increased intraalveolar cholesterol in the present study cats exposed to ohp until the animals convulsed intermittently for min approximately hour ata similarly showed altered surfactants with a high minimum surface tension and a increase in intraalveolar cholesterol these changes also occurred in the absence of any gross lung injury the results from the present study suggest that an important causal mechanism involved in the development of gross lung injury associated with prolonged ohp exposure is an initial increase in minimum surface tension due to increased intraalveolar cholesterol
SPM,statistical parametric mapping,TS-3122,whilst ACL AL injury commonly occurs during NC of direction cod tasks there is little research on how athletes execute cod T3 ACL ligament reconstruction aclr the aims of this study were to determine betweenlimb and betweentest differences in performance time and joint kinematics and kinetics during planned and unplanned cod one hundred and fiftysix male subjects carried out Â° maximal effort planned and unplanned cod tests in a d motion capture laboratory months after aclr SPM Ã\x97 anova limb Ã\x97 test was used to identify differences in cod time and biomechanical measures between limbs and between tests there was no interaction effect but a main effect for limb and task there was no betweenlimb difference in the time to CR both cod tests betweenlimb differences were found for internal knee valgus moment knee IR and flexion angle KE and ER moment and ankle ER moment with lower values on the aclr side effect size between test differences were found with less contralateral pelvis rotation distance from centre of mass to the ankle in FC plane posterior ground reaction force and greater hip abduction during the unplanned cod effect size findings demonstrated that kinematic and kinetic differences between limbs are evident during both cod tests months after surgery despite no statistical differences in performance time biomechanical differences between tests were found in variables which have previously been associated with acl injury mechanism during unplanned cod

RE,rejection episodes,TS-3124,despite a different molecular structure and PSA properties cyclosporine and tacrolimusby inhibiting calcineurin activityhave been shown in the previous two decades of solid organ transplantation to be well tolerated and effective immunosuppressants initial RCTs showed a lower incidence of acute AAR in tacrolimus than in cyclosporinetreated patients in combination with CS and azathioprine but in conjunction with mycophenolate mofetil the difference in the incidence of acute RE is less clear in GA short and mediumterm outcome variables year serum creatinine graft and patient survival with cyclosporine and tacrolimus are excellent and almost MZ with both substances having the same intrinsic nephrotoxic potential on the other hand cyclosporine and tacrolimus have a different impact on cardiovascular risk factors with tacrolimus having a better profile on arterial tension and lipid metabolism and cyclosporine on gl metabolism however at present no data are available to discern that these differences in risk profile alter patient or GS or LT cardiovascular morbiditymortality therefore prospective longterm trials are needed to study the quantitative impact of different IS agents and concomitant cardiovascular risk AF on longterm patient and graft survival before evidencebased patient graft or cardiovascular risk reduction can be firmly claimed by tailoring calcineurin inhibitors
PLP,phantom limb pain,TS-3125,sex differences in pain are frequently reported in the literature however less is known about possible sex differences in the experience of pain AA to a disability the current T0 explored these issues in persons with limb loss n men who were recruited as part of a postal survey participants provided ratings of PLP plp residual limb pain rlp and general PI participants also completed measures of painrelated interference catastrophizing coping and beliefs results indicated that a greater proportion of males than females vs respectively reported the presence of plp however this difference was no longer prominent when cause of limb loss was controlled no sex differences were found in the presence of rlp or in average intensity ratings of plp or rlp in contrast females reported greater overall average PI and interference than males females also endorsed significantly greater catastrophizing use of certain paincoping strategies and beliefs related to several aspects of pain this T0 did not find prominent sex differences in pain TPS to limb loss however several sex differences in the overall biopsychosocial experience of pain did emerge that are consistent with the broader literature
PE,prolonged exposure,TS-3126,we report a case of prenatal exposure to angiotensin ii receptor antagonists ara ii from the beginning of pregnancy in a patient with a hypokinetic dilated cardiomyopathy this case report emphasizes the fetal renal impact of prolonged intrauterine exposure to reninangiotensin system ras blockers and highlights that this exposure can cause severe prenatal hypocalvaria this delayed ossification can be reversible after birth but the presence of anhydramnios indicates an early and irreversible block of ras blockers in the fetus that is responsible for fetal kidney OD abnormalities this association carries a high risk of neonatal death PE to ara ii or other ras blockers remains prohibited throughout pregnancy
CS,patients with cushings syndrome,TS-3127,regulation of cortisol secretion by aberrant hormone receptors may play a role in the pathogenesis of acthindependent cushings syndrome in this T0 the topic was evaluated by combining in vivo and in vitro approaches cortisol responses to various stimuli standard meal gnrh trh cisapride vasopressin glucagon were assessed in patients with clinical or subclinical adrenal cushings syndrome and nonfunctioning adrenal adenoma in two cases abnormal responses were observed in three CS one patient showed a GIP gipdependent cortisol rise after meal together with responses T3 gnrh and cisapride the second patient showed an lhdependent cortisol response to gnrh and in the third cortisol rose T3 cisapride the pattern of receptor expression performed by rtpcr showed that while gipr was only expressed in RT from the responsive patient hydroxytryptamine type receptor and lhr were also present in normal adrenal tissues and tissues from nonresponsive patients interestingly an activating mutation of gsalpha gene was identified in one of these PT therefore cortisol responses to agents operating via gs protein coupled receptors in one case associated with gsalpha mutation were found in cushings patients while these responses were absent in the others the finding of receptor expression in normal and nonresponsive PT suggests that different mechanisms are probably involved in inducing in vivo cortisol responses

AR,augmented reality,TS-3136,the calibration of a projectorcamera system is an essential step toward accurate d measurement and environmentaware data projection applications such as AR in this paper we present a twostage easytodeploy strategy for robust calibration of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a projector two key components of the system are the automatic generation of projected light patterns and the incremental calibration process based on the incremental strategy the calibration process first establishes a set of initial parameters and then it upgrades these parameters incrementally using the projection and captured images of dynamicallygenerated calibration patterns the scenedriven light patterns allow the system to adapt itself to the pose of the calibration target such that the difficulty in feature detection is greatly lowered the strategy forms a closedloop system that performs selfcorrection as more and more observations become available compared to the conventional method which requires a timeconsuming process for the acquisition of dense pixel correspondences the proposed method deploys a homographybased coordinate computation allowing the calibration time to be dramatically reduced the experimental results indicate that an improvement of in reprojection errors is achievable and of the calibration time can be saved

ZF,zona fasciculata,TS-3139,a yearold woman presented with intracranial hemorrhage laboratory examinations revealed severe hypertension hypokalemia elevated aldosterone excretion and suppressed plasma renin activity left HPA tumor was suspected and adrenalectomy was performed the laboratory data T3 operation however showed no significant difference from the preoperative data on the basis of further examinations dexamethasone was administered and returned blood pressure to normal and also normalized serum potassium plasma aldosterone and renin activity the patients illness was diagnosed as GSH light microscopically the zona glomerulosa was hypertrophic and the outer ZF decreased in lipid droplets and was centrifugally arranged in small alveoli electronmicroscopically the cells of the outer ZF had several lipid droplets and welldeveloped ser mitochondria were round to oval with lamellar or lamellovesicular cristae these findings were evidence of hyperfunction the cytoplasm of the cells also contained spironolactone bodies therefore it is assumed that the aldosterone which induced the disorder was produced mainly in the outer zona fasciculata
HR,homologous recombination,TS-3140,the dispersion of four replicationdefective endogenous proviruses originally detected in strain mice and shown to have extensive deletions of gag pol and env gene regions was investigated in inbred strains and substrains of mice using probes to sequences flanking the integration CS in mice unique genomic eco ri fragments were assigned to each of the four endogenous proviral elements analyses revealed that certain of these proviral elements are present both in strains closely related to CS ie strains and lpj and in more distantly related strains ie strains balbcj aj and chhej in mouse strains lacking proviral integration at a particular locus the size of the corresponding eco ri genomic fragment and absence of a characteristic kpn i site indicated the lack of a residual solitary long terminal repeat hybridization of oligonucleotide probes that distinguish the specific deletions present within these elements identified additional analogous proviral integrations at many different CS in all strains investigated these data indicate that the diversification of these proviral elements found in inbred strains is generated by integration of new copies rather than excision through HR moreover the results are consistent with other endogenous retroviruses providing the transacting proteins necessary to package the defective viral rna
ID,internal derangement,TS-3141,this T0 measures the effects of treatment interventions on two classes of temporomandibular disorder tmd patients in a dental practice in ottawa canada other studies of tmd treatment outcome have employed subjective largely qualitative and nonquantitative measures of symptom levels to make this type of assessment rendering such research largely incapable of being replicated the current study employs the tmj scale a validated and psychometricallydeveloped symptom inventory to measure symptom levels before and after treatment the study first determined the sensitivity and specificity of the tmj scale for patients in the practice population one hundred and eleven consecutive tmd patients completed tmj scales prior to treatment and then were retested T3 the completion of treatment results indicate that patients with symptoms of internal joint derangement reported more symptomatic improvement than those with predominantly muscular symptomology despite the fact that the latter manifested lower symptom C2 initially patients with ID PS initially presented with lower levels of psychological PS than patients with muscular symptoms substantial improvements in both CG were noted employing tmj scale percentile rank changes as outcome measures this study can serve as a MM for future research toward establishing baselines for expected tmd symptom improvement
UC,undifferentiated carcinoma,TS-3142,squamous differentiation of thyroid carcinoma was studied clinicopathologically and immunohistochemically in autopsy cases RT cell nests with squamous differentiation cnsd which histologically resembled squamous cell carcinoma were found in cases all of these cases with cnsd had Az of UC representing of cases with UC and all but one case also showed coexisting papillary carcinoma the cnsd were histologically associated with undifferentiated carcinoma in cases and with papillary carcinoma in one case the cnsd were occasionally intermingled with these types of carcinoma and there were findings suggesting a histological transition between the cnsd and UC or papillary carcinoma immunohistochemistry revealed that all the cnsd were reactive with antibodies for keratin and vimentin whereas thyroglobulin and desmin were not expressed it was concluded that the cnsd examined here were most probably due to extensive squamous differentiation squamous metaplasia in UC and PTC carcinoma in addition the present results may explain the fact that cases diagnosed solely as squamous cell carcinoma sometimes show a prognosis similar to that of UC and may well represent extensive squamous differentiation in such tumors rather than true squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid
HDT,highdose therapy,TS-3143,highdose chemoradiotherapy with autologous SC transplantation asct has introduced the concept of CR remission for multiple myeloma and can improve survival and life SQ for selected CG of myeloma patients a number of prognostic AF have been identified where asct in early disease ie as part of frontline treatment seems to be of particular importance for a favourable outcome even so most myeloma patients will not be cured by HDT but new strategies such as repeated autografting and postgraft IFN maintenance treatment seem to add additional advantages with rue lowered the PCD rate of ds pregnancies with only a small and insignificant effect on the falsepositive rate our results call for special caution in the addition of markers for risk calculations we suggest that pregnancies with a calculated risk of following MS alphafetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin markers tests should be regarded as highrisk pregnancies even in cases in whom the addition of ue lowers the risk beneath the cutoff value
EP,egg production,TS-3144,the food marketbasket survey in taiwan found high C2 of PCDDs and dibenzofurans pcddfs in duck eggs a subsequent survey in changhua county CE taiwan found nine duck farms for EP and duck eggs that were highly contaminated by pcddfs in the AA sampling and analysis during the years to duckegg farmers eat duck eggs rather than chicken eggs and the aim of the current study was to evaluate how eating contaminated duck eggs affected SS pcddf accumulation and pcddf profiles in family members of duckegg farmers fortytwo family members of duckegg farmers and residents living nearby control group were recruited serum pcddf levels were significantly higher in duckegg farmers than in the control group vs pg world health organization toxic equivalency teqg lipid whoteq significant differences in pcddf C2 were found for most congeners especially for pentachlorinated dibenzofurans elevated SS pcddf levels were positively associated with an increase in monthly duckegg consumption after adjustments for fish consumption the current result contradicted results of our previous study which showed a positive association between fish intake and SS pcddf levels the matter of cultivation in the contaminant area in changhua county should be considered more seriously
ER,estrogen receptor status,TS-3145,CA of the cell cycle are present in all neoplasms cyclin e which regulates the gs Tm of the cell cycle plays an important role in many different cancers to further investigate the role of cyclin e in invasive breast ductal carcinomas in south african women representative sections from mastectomy and AC specimens were stained with the cyclin e antibody the results were compared with known clinicopathologic prognostic AF namely lymph node metastases size ER and histologic grade positive nuclear cyclin e immunostaining strongly correlates with negative ER and high grade these correlations may account for the observation that although cyclin e IF is associated with poor prognosis in univariate analysis no prognostic significance remains after MVA
CL,confidence level,TS-3146,this study examined criterionrelated validity and clinimetric properties of the pediatric balance scale pbs in children with CBF palsy cp fortyfive children with cp age range months and their parents participated in this T0 at baseline and at follow up pearson rho coefficients were used to determine criterionrelated validity by analyzing the correlation between the pbs including pbsstatic pbsdynamic and pbstotal and criterion measures including the gross motor CF measure items gmfm and functional independence measures for children weefim responsiveness was examined by paired t test and by standardized response mean srm the minimal detectable change mdc was analyzed at the CL and the minimal clinically important differences mcid was estimated by anchorbased and distributionbased approaches the pbs with gmfm and weefim showed fairtoexcellent concurrent validity at i.c.v. and follow up and predictive validity the srm values of all pbs scales were for the pbsstatic pbsdynamic and pbstotal the mdc values were and and the mcid ranges were and respectively improvement of at least mdc values on the pbs can be considered a true NC not measurement error a mean NC must exceed the mcid range on pbs to be considered clinically important change therefore all pbs scales were moderately responsive to NC clinicians and researchers can use these clinimetric data for pbs to determine if a change score represents a true or clinically meaningful effect at posttreatment and follow up
IEC,ionexchange chromatography,TS-3147,this T0 was performed to isolate and investigate the iga that could accumulate in glomeruli glomerulophilic iga iga was fractionated by the electric charge and the CR to jacalin serum iga of iga nephropathy patients was separated and fractionated using a jacalin column and subsequent IEC the fractions were divided into three groups of relatively cationic c neutral n and anionic a iga was also divided into jacalin low l intermediate i and high h affinity fractions by serial elution using and mm galactose the left kidneys of wistar rats were perfused with or mg of each group of iga the rats were sacrificed min min h or h T3 the perfusion the accumulation of each iga in the glomeruli was then observed by immunofluorescence the iga of the fractions n and h separated by the two methods was definitely accumulated in the rat glomeruli with a similar DP the electrophoresis revealed that the macromolecular iga was increased in fraction h compared with other fractions therefore jacalin highaffinity igafraction h was applied on a diethylaminoethyl column and divided into electrically cationic hc neutral hn and anionic ha only the asialogalbetagalnac chain was identified in the fraction hn iga by gasphase hydrazinolysis furthermore the iga fraction was strongly recognized by PNA vicia villosa lectins and antisynthetic hinge peptide antibody these results indicated that the iga molecules having the underglycosylated hinge glycopeptide played a certain role in the glomerular accumulation of iga in iga nephropathy
CF,case fatality,TS-3148,a populationbased T0 was conducted in metropolitan baltimore in which the short and longterm prognosis of patients with nontransmural myocardial infarction was compared with that of patients with transmural infraction T3 simultaneous adjustment for several variables the inhospital CF rate was greater for patients with transmural percent than with nontransmural percent infarction p less than however for patients discharged alive from the hospital and followed up for as long as years no significant differences in survival were found between the CG with transmural and nontransmural infarction a multiple adjustment procedure yield year CF rates of percent and percent respectively for patients with transmural and nontransmural myocardial infarction surviving the acute phase these results suggest that the LT prognosis of patients with nontransmural infarction is as guarded as that of patients with transmural infarction and that attempts to prevent subsequent mortality should be diligently pursued in both CG of patients
SM,salmeterol,TS-3149,the effects of the longacting beta agonist salmeterol on early and late phase airways events provoked by inhaled allergen were assessed in a group of atopic AP in a placebocontrolled study SM micrograms inhaled before allergen challenge ablated both the early and late phase of allergeninduced BC over a h time period SM also CR inhibited the allergeninduced rise in nonspecific bronchial responsiveness over the same time period these effects were shown to be unrelated to prolonged bronchodilatation or PET antagonism these data suggest novel actions for topically active LA beta agonists in asthma that extend beyond their protective action on airways smooth muscle

MS,multiplescattering,TS-3157,we propose and experimentally verify a method to program the ERP transmission matrix of general multiport linear optical circuits in random MS materials by phase modulation of incident wavefronts we demonstrate the SP of our method by NLP linear optical circuits in white paint layers with inputs and outputs and inputs and outputs using interferometric techniques we verify our ability to program any desired phase relation between the outputs the method works in a deterministic manner and can be directly applied to existing wavefrontshaping setups without the need of measuring a transmission matrix or to rely on sensitive interference measurements
TN,thermoneutral,TS-3158,an experiment was conducted to determine if ergot alkaloids affect blood flow to the absorptive surface of the rumen steers n were pairfed alfalfa cubes and received ground endophyteinfected neotyphodium coenophialum tall fescue lolium arundinaceum e seed mg ergovalineÂ·kg bwÂ·d or endophytefree tall fescue e seed via the rumen cannula x daily for d at TN tn Â°c and HS HS Â°c conditions on d the rumen was emptied and rinsed a buffer containing vfa was incubated in the following CS control con Î¼g ergovalineÂ·kg bw Ã\x97ext from a tall fescue seed extract and Î¼g ergovalineÂ·kg bw Ã\x97ext for each buffer treatment there were two min incubations a min incubation of a treatment buffer with no sampling followed by an incubation of an MZ sampling buffer with the addition of credta and deuterium oxide do epithelial blood flow was calculated as ruminal clearance of do corrected for influx of physiological water and liquid outflow feed intake decreased with dosing e seed at HS but not at thermoneutral conditions tn p dosing e seed decreased serum prolactin p at tn at HS prolactin decreased in both CG over the d experiment p but there was no difference in e and e steers p there was a seed treatmentÃ\x97buffer ATI at tn p indicating that e seed treatment decreased reticuloruminal epithelial blood flow at tn during the con incubation but the two CG of steers were not different during Ã\x97ext and Ã\x97ext p inclusion of the extract in the buffer caused at least a reduction in epithelial blood flow at tn p but there was no difference between Ã\x97ext and Ã\x97ext there was a seed Ã\x97 buffer ATI at HS p indicating that the reduction of blood flow induced by incubating the extract was larger for steers receiving e seed than e seed volatile fatty acid flux was reduced during the Ã\x97ext and Ã\x97ext treatments p an additional experiment was conducted to determine the effect of time on blood flow and vfa flux because buffer CS could not be randomized time either increased p or did not affect blood flow p or vfa flux p indicating that observed differences are due to the presence of ergot alkaloids in the rumen a decrease in vfa absorption could contribute to the signs of fescue toxicosis including depressed growth and performance
CMS,solubilization,TS-3159,targeting receptors to appropriate locations on the cell surface is a critical task for neurons we have examined the possibility that rapsyn controls the distribution of nicotinic receptors on SN as it does nicotinic receptors on muscle SF cotransfection of qt cells with rapsyn and neuronal nicotinic receptor cdna constructs produced receptor aggregates or clusters that codistributed in part with rapsyn protein though all nicotinic receptor subtypes tested were affected by rapsyn receptors containing the alpha gene product were among the most responsive in addition rapsyn caused a portion of the nicotinic receptors containing alpha subunits to become resistant to CMS with nonionic detergent and to display a marked increase in metabolic stability the results are consistent with rapsyn linking the receptors to CSK elements and suggest that it may play an organizing role determining the fate and location of nicotinic receptors on SN
WT,wildtype controls,TS-3160,apolipoprotein e apoe is highly expressed in AT and adipocytes in which its expression is regulated by peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor ppargamma agonists and TN factoralpha there is however no information regarding a role for endogenous apoe in differentiated adipocyte CF in this report we define a novel role for apoe in modulating adipocyte lipid metabolism apoe mice have less body fat and smaller adipocytes compared with WT freshly isolated AT from apoe mice contains lower C2 of triglyceride and free HFA and these differences are maintained in cultured adipocytes derived from preadipocytes adenoviral expression of apoe in apoecultured adipocytes increases triglyceride and fatty acid content during incubation with apoecontaining triglyceriderich lipoproteins apoe adipose tissue accumulates less triglyceride than wild type the absence of apoe expression in primary cultured adipocytes also leads to changes in the expression of genes involved in the metabolismturnover of fatty acids and the triglyceride droplet markers of adipocyte differentiation were lower in freshly isolated and cultured apoe adipocytes importantly ppargammamediated changes in lipid content and gene expression are markedly altered in cultured apoe adipocytes these results establish a novel role for endogenous apoe in adipocyte lipid metabolism and have implications for constructing an integrated MM of adipocyte physiology in health and disease
BT,behavior therapy,TS-3161,BT is effective for persistent tic disorders ptds but behavioral processes facilitating tic reduction are not well understood one process habituation is thought to create tic reduction through decreases in premonitory urge severity the current study tested whether premonitory urges decreased in youth with ptds n and adults with ptds n who participated in parallel randomized PCTs comparing BT to psychoeducation and supportive therapy pst trends in premonitory urges tic severity and treatment outcome were analyzed according to the predictions of a habituation model whereby urge severity would be expected to decrease in those who responded to BT although adults who responded to BT showed a significant trend of declining premonitory urge severity across treatment results failed to demonstrate that behavior therapy specifically caused changes in premonitory urge severity in addition reductions in premonitory urge severity in those who responded to BT were significant greater than those who did not respond to BT but no different than those who responded or did not respond to pst children with ptds failed to show any significant changes in premonitory urges reductions in premonitory urge severity did not mediate the relationship between treatment and outcome in either adults or children these results cast doubt on the notion that habituation is the therapeutic process underlying the effectiveness of BT which has immediate implications for the psychoeducation and therapeutic rationale presented in clinical practice moreover there may be important developmental changes in premonitory urges in ptds and alternative models of therapeutic NC warrant investigation

MIS,minimally invasive surgery,TS-3172,over the past decades staging laparoscopy evolved as a useful tool in multimodality treatment of patients with abdominal HM especially for detection of incurable peritoneal and liver metastasis natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery notes is a new evolving technique which represents the next logical progression in MIS and has theoretical advantages in comparison with standard LS a review of the current literature revealed a continuous increasing number of fundamental and clinical studies addressing notes approach in multimodal management of oncologic patients technical possibility to use this new minimally invasive RPA for oncological resection of abdominal HM was proved by some investigators
SG,subtotal gastrectomy,TS-3173,in a historical prospective cohort investigation of patients undergoing peptic ulcer surgery in hospitals in the western part of denmark from through the risk of subsequent GC development was studied the patients were followed with regard to gastric CA development until their death or the end of the year and the incidence of cancer in this cohort was compared to the incidence in the total population in the same region during the same period a total of gastric cancers were diagnosed versus expected up to years after T0 the CA risk was lower than expected T3 years the risk was higher than expected with a fold higher incidence after years for the total patient population the highest risk was observed in male subjects undergoing a BII SG with a times increase in risk T3 years there was no difference between gastric and DU and patients undergoing simple suture for a perforated ulcer showed no increase in cancer incidence patients with longlasting symptoms had the same incidence as patients with briefer symptoms these observations indicate that the T0 per se and not the UD may be precancerous
TP,thymopoietin,TS-3174,balbc euthymic and nunu athymic mice were treated intraperitoneally with tp a synthetic tetrapeptide TP sequence analog pharmaceutical products factory gedeon richter budapest hungary or with mannozym zymosan suspension institute for serobacterological production and research human budapest hungary and were INF intracerebrally with lcm virus both of the agents contributed to the development of fatal choriomeningitis consequently they stimulated the cellular immune response in euthymic mice but the athymic mice either treated or not survived the infection consequently the agents had no effect on the course of lcm virus infection the results showed that the cellular immune response stimulating effect by both agents was thymusdependent using these agents immunostimulatory effect can be realized only in the presence of the thymus or the TD lymphoid system respectively
ST,standard therapy,TS-3175,recent advances in RT immunology a better understanding of mechanisms regulating the immune response has led to experimental and clinical testing of a novel type of immunotherapeutics antibodies blocking negative RII mechanisms of tcell activation corrected the application of the ctla antagonist ipilimumab the prototype of this new class of immune stimulating agents represents the first treatment that resulted in significant prolongation of the survival of M1 melanoma patients in randomized controlled trial leading to the approval of its use for the therapy of these patients in together with the braf inhibitor vemurafenib which was also approved in ipilimumab has changed the ST of M1 melanoma and also paved the way for other agents aiming at influencing immune regulating molecules of which antibodies blocking the pd pathway also showed promising clinical activity according to clinical experience collected so far these agents induce objective tumor response in a relatively small proportion of patients with a characteristic response kinetics frequently showing delayed activity but resulting in durable remission in a considerable proportion of the responding patients on the other hand antitumor activity is frequently accompanied by significant toxicity the spectrum of side effects is different from that of conventional therapies and a C1 part of them is caused by the enhanced systemic immune activity in order to spare nonresponding patients of the severe side effects and to increase response rate the search for biomarkers that could help in identifying patients likely to react to the treatment represents an important focus of studies furthermore OD of combinations with other immunotherapeutic modalities chemo or targeted therapies may further increase the efficiency of immunomodulatory antibodies

TD,tissue doppler,TS-3177,the CF of the HR was studied in asphyxiated term neonates by measuring the longitudinal peak systolic strain and peak systolic SR by TD in segments of the heart on days and of life the FS was assessed at each examination as well measurements were compared against measurements in healthy term neonates examined by the same protocol the function of the HR was lower in the asphyxiated neonates peak systolic CS mean confidence interval peak systolic SR per second than in the healthy term neonates peak systolic CS PSV SR per second p fractional shortening was similar in the asphyxiated and healthy term neonates p the PSV CS differed significantly between the asphyxiated and healthy term neonates for the left basal and right basal CG of segments p but not for the left apical right apical septum apical or septum basal groups of segments the peak systolic strain rate differed significantly only for the septum apical group of segments the differences were largest on the second day of life measurements were similar in asphyxiated neonates with elevated and normal cardiac troponin t C2 the PSV CS and SR were in this T0 more CS indices than fractional shortening for assessing the reduced myocardial CF in asphyxiated term neonates
AM,aseptic meningitis,TS-3178,sandfly fever virus is known to cause pappataci fever the sandfly fever virus belongs to the genus phlebovirus family bunyaviridae and is endemically found in areas of south europe asia and africa in germany pappataci fever is only described in connection with travelling to endemic Az we report on a yearold girl suffering from sandfly fever virus infection after vacation in turkey the initial PS started with fever for about three days frontal headache nausea and arthralgia after a short time of clinical improvement PS recurred and our patient entered hospital with signs of severe meningitis liquor analysis showed a lymphocytic meningitis due to multiple insect bites on her legs sandfly fever was suspected blood analysis confirmed an acute infection with sandfly virus sicilian from which she completely recovered elisa and immunoblot analysis revealed an infection with sandfly virus serotype sicilian which was not encountered with meningitis so far our case report illustrates that due to increased tourism sandfly fever virus infection has to be considered as a cause of AM in travellers
FP,family planning,TS-3179,assuming that work contexts are changing and becoming ever more diverse questions have been raised about the current state and relevance of job design theory in this paper we review the field of job design from three paradigmatic perspectives namely functionalism interpretivism and critical theory we point out that the core of job design theory across all paradigms has traditionally been concerned with the outcomes of job design the role of key AF such as control demand and skill and how jobs can be changed by outlining two scenarios about how work is changing we argue that although job design still has a lot to offer its traditional core concerns are still relevant it must develop to have a wider appeal and to have more relevance finally we propose how job design can develop as a field these proposals are based on our belief that job design theory can progress most fully if it dralldocumented unmet demand for family planning in nearly all highfertility countries improved FP and safe abortion services will improve the health of women and their families accelerate fertility decline and help preserve the environment many ecologically vulnerable areas are especially poorly served by family planning services examples are given here of improving family planning services through private health providers near the kakamega forest in western kenya and of adding family planning choices to a reforestation project run by the jane goodall institute near the gombe national park tanzania wildlife biologists can play a critical role in identifying local professionals and institutions with the potential to improve FP

CST,stand trial,TS-3183,persons found incompetent to CST comprise the largest group of psychiatric patients committed to mental hospitals through the criminal justice system in the united states the law dictates that these patients receive ST treatment aimed specifically at enabling them to CST with as little delay as possible the author describes the treatment and assessment aspects of a program that admits approximately trialincompetent persons each year during of the patients discharged from this program were certified by the treatment staff as competent to CST of that group subsequently completed the trial process
SSA,subsaharan africa,TS-3184,this T0 investigates the presence of enterocytozoon bieneusi in domestic and wild animals living in the wildlifelivestock interface area of the kruger national park knp in SA fifty fecal samples from domestic calves in rural communities and fecal samples from impala aepyceros melampus and buffalo syncerus caffer in the knp were analysed for enterocytozoon bieneusi using a nested pcr targeting the internal transcribed spacer of the rrna gene all wildlife samples were negative for e bieneusi whereas nine calf samples were positive three cattle TPS genotypes group were identified belonging to the known genotypes beb and i and one novel TT beblike one humanpathogenic genotype d was detected in one calf this is the first study on microsporidia performed in a wildlifelivestock interface area of SSA our findings show that at least one TT of zoonotic importance is circulating in native cattle in the T0 area and the rest of the identified microsporidia were hostspecific genotypes larger studies in domestic animals humans and wildlife are necessary to assess the public health significance of e bieneusi in that interface area
IA,immunoadsorption,TS-3185,therapeutic protocol and indication of IA therapy ia for LN ln have not been established although it has been reported to be ERP in resistant cases here we performed ia and double filtration plasmapheresis dfpp in combination with highdose methyprednisolone in patients with ln and studied possible indications of ia
TP,torsades de pointes,TS-3186,an year old woman was prescribed treatment with terodilin for urge incontinence the drug was administered daily by a nurse about a fortnight later she had several syncopes in the course of three to four days on admission to hospital the electrocardiogram showed recurring TP VVI tachycardias VVI pacing prevented any further arrhythmia an internal pacemaker was therefore implanted the qtinterval was probably prolonged after two weeks on terodilin compared with the interval shown on an electrocardiogram taken earlier
RP,red pulp,TS-3187,the anatomy and pathology of the splenic RP was studied in threedimensional reconstructions of MMA embedded blocks of tissue obtained T3 splenectomy as well as by morphometrical analysis of a C1 number of specimens the sinuses of the spleen form a plexus of anastomosing vessels with remarkable buds capillaries end as sheathed capillaries in the cord tissue the filtering area but a large proportion of the red pulp cords appear to be nonfiltering these might form part of the lymphatic compartment which is separate from the WG pulp and its extension along the capillaries this area has not yet been described in man the change in the volume and structure of the various components of the RP were studied in controls and in cases of traumatic rupture ITP AA autoimmune haemolytic anaemia congenital spherocytosis splenic congestion and hodgkins disease significant differences were found in the volume of filtering and nonfiltering areas the size of the sinus compartment and the degree of vascularization these differences were only partially expected for instance in disorders with excessive erythrocyte sequestration a decrease of the nonfiltering area in hodgkins disease might indicate an unknown aspect of this disease in agreement with our previous paper on the amount of WG pulp spleens removed because of traumatic rupture and those incidentally removed during abdominal surgery may not be combined as a single control group because of significant and probably functional differences in the composition also of the RP
DL,dim light,TS-3188,the effects of ultraviolet b uvb nm radiation on certain vital physiological photosynthesis biochemical production of reactive oxygen species ros and behavioral motility and orientation characteristics were investigated in the unicellular photoautotroph euglena agilis carter the photosynthetic performance of e agilis was recorded after exposure of between and min followed by a period of recovery lasting h under DL Î¼mol photons m s the maximum quantum yield of ps ii fvfm was reduced to and of initial values immediately following and min uvb exposure but recovered to and of the initials respectively values of retrmax in e agilis exposed to min uvb were similar to those of the initials but a min uv SE resulted in reduction of retrmax with only a recovery as compared with the initial after h recovery after a min uvb exposure there were no chl a fluorescence signals and hence no fvfm or retrmax a uv dosedependent increase in dcfhda fluorescence was found in e agilis cells reflecting an increase in ros production T3 exposures to uvb for between and min the percentages of motile cells in the population decreased to and respectively following h in DL the percentage of motile cells increased to between and of the initial value the velocity of nonirradiated cells was Î¼m s which decreased to Î¼m s immediately following exposure for min T3 periods of time in DL and h velocities had recovered to between and of the initial value in UT controls the rvalue was indicating random movement of e agilis but it increased to and after exposure to uvb for and min respectively there was a tendency towards vertical downward movement of cells proportional to the duration of exposure the compactness of e agilis decreased from in controls to in cells treated with uvb although significant recovery followed uvb dosedependent interaction between photosynthetic activity ros production and movement is discussed in terms of a uvprotective mechanism in e agilis
AL,anterolateral,TS-3189,the AL meniscal root almr has been reported to intricately insert underneath the tibial IS of the ACL AL acl prthey often occur concurrently but are sometimes independent findings the consistent relation between ed and sevofluranebased anesthesia has guided many studies to investigate its incidence compared with using other anesthetic techniques or various adjuncts the risk of ed is lowest when propofol is used as a singleagent anesthetic compared with sevofluranebased anesthetics adjunctive agents can be rated in the following order of most effective to least effective interventions dexmedetomidine FE ketamine clonidine and propofol bolus at the end of sevofluranebased anesthesia this review summarizes the AF that may predict ed and provides an intervention algorithm to guide effective prevention and treatment
ER,emergency room,TS-3190,to determine the tau of oral corticosteroids antihistamines and sympathomimetics in treating patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis the charts of patients diagnosed with IA from to treated at a single center were reviewed sixtyone patients females and males were available for longterm followup ages ranged from to years with an average of years patients with frequent episodes were treated with a protocol of oral corticosteroids antihistamines and sympathomimetics patients with infrequent episodes were treated for acute episodes only the number of emergency room visits hospitalizations intensive care unit admissions and length of time in remission were recorded sixtyfive percent of patients with infrequent episodes and of patients with frequent episodes of idiopathic anaphylaxis went into remission significant decreases in ER visits occurred for the idiopathic anaphylaxisgeneralizedfrequent group p the idiopathicanaphylaxisgeneralizedinfrequent group p and the idiopathic anaphylaxisangioedemainfrequent group p significant decreases in the number of hospitalizations p and intensive ECU admissions p occurred for the idiopathic anaphylaxisgeneralizedinfrequent and frequent groups respectively overall an estimated was saved with the treatment program for patientyears IA can be controlled and remission induced in most patients an estimated million per year can be saved for patients in the usa on the basis of the estimated prevalence in this country
GP,growth plate,TS-3191,filamins are a family of actinbinding proteins responsible for diverse biological functions in the context of regulating actin dynamics and vesicle trafficking disruption of these proteins has been implicated in multiple human developmental disorders to investigate the roles of different filamin isoforms we focused on flna and flnb interactions in the cartilage GP since mutations in both molecules cause chondrodysplasias current studies show that flna and flnb share a common CF in stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton they physically interact in the cytoplasm of chondrocytes and loss of flna enhances flnb expression of chondrocytes in the GP and vice versa suggesting compensation prolonged flnb loss however promotes actinstress fiber formation following plating onto an Int activating substrate whereas flna inhibition leads to decreased actin formation flna more strongly binds rhoa although both filamins overlap with rhoa expression in the cell cytoplasm flna promotes rhoa activation whereas flnb indirectly inhibits this pathway moreover flna loss leads to diminished expression of Î²integrin whereas flnb loss promotes Int expression finally fibronectin mediated integrin activation has been shown to activate rhoa and activated rhoa leads to stress fiber formation and cell spreading fibronectin stimulation in null flna cells impairs enhanced spreading whereas flnb inhibited cells show enhanced spreading while filamins serve a primary static function in stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton these studies are the first to demonstrate a dynamic and antagonistic relationship between different filamin isoforms in the dynamic regulation of integrin expression rhogtpase activity and actin AS fiber CR
RA,room air,TS-3192,nuclear magnetic resonance nmr imaging shows promise in the measurement of human CBF blood flow cbf in that nonradioactive indicators may be used our earlier investigations with trifluoromethane fc gas have shown that this compound can be used to safely and effectively measure cbf in anesthetized animal models in this phase i doseescalation study we set out to determine the maximal tolerated concentration mtc of fc in normal healthy male volunteers and to assess its feasibility as an nmr indicator five subjects were exposed in a blinded fashion to escalating concentrations of fc between and randomly interleaved with exposures to both RA and nitrous oxide on each study day the subjects breathed the test gas for eight pulses of min each with min clearance periods between the pulses the subjects underwent intensive physiologic and neurobehavioral monitoring throughout the T0 period the first subject experienced an anesthetic response to fc and the second subject experienced discomfort and requested discontinuation at the initiation of fc the mtc was subsequently determined to be fc all subjects tolerated the gas although a small vs but statistically significant PR of carbon dioxide was found p when one subject received fc during an nmr imaging T0 a pronounced anesthetic effect with intolerable hyperacusis was demonstrated human studies of fc have been discontinued in our laboratory
NF,neurofibromatosis,TS-3193,we report on a yearold man suffering from type NF with spontaneous rupture of a lower pole artery of the right kidney two renal arteries with aneurysmal alterations were identified at angiography we did not coil the lower pole artery because active one had stopped eleven days later the patient suffered a further spontaneous rupture to the right main renal artery and nephrectomy was unavoidable his recovery was rapid and unremarkable
PD,preferred direction,TS-3194,detecting visual features in the environment such as motion direction is crucial for survival the circuit mechanisms that give rise to direction selectivity in a L1 visual center the superior colliculus sc are entirely unknown we optogenetically isolate the retinal inputs that individual directionselective sc neurons receive and find that they are already selective as a result of precisely converging inputs from similarly tuned retinal ganglion cells the directionselective retinal input is linearly amplified by intracollicular circuits without changing its PD or level of selectivity finally using twophoton calcium imaging we show that sc direction selectivity is dramatically reduced in transgenic mice that have decreased retinal selectivity together our studies demonstrate a retinal origin of direction selectivity in the sc and reveal a CE visual deficit as a consequence of altered feature selectivity in the retina
BR,basic region,TS-3195,the ef transcription factor binds to sites within the promoters of a number of cell cycle regulated genes through a basichelixloophelix motif bhlh it is shown here that the BR of ef is distinct from that of all other bhlh proteins the center of the BR contains a helix breaking prolineglycine pair p g implying a turn within this region this is in contrast to the known bhlh containing proteins where the BR is alphahelical substitution of p and g with alanines results in a significant reduction in dna binding levels with the predicted formation of an alphahelix also in contrast to other bhlh proteins mutations generated in conserved basic residues of ef do not effect dna binding in addition a single leucine between helix no and the leucine zipper is required for dna IB while the leucine zipper itself is not necessary finally ef interacts with all of the gresidues in the sequence ggcgggaaa while the aresidues are not required for dna binding the uniqueness of the ef dna binding domain is likely to play a role in its binding a dna site that is distinct from that of all other bhlh proteins cacgtg
SG,subtotal gastrectomy,TS-3196,lanthanum carbonate lc is an orally po phosphate binder its absorption is generally thought to be minimal we report here the case of an yearold woman who underwent SG for gastric cancer T3 receiving hemodialysis for year and taking lc for months lanthanum phosphate EDC were found histologically in the gastric mucosa and a regional lymph node and confirmed by scanning and transmission electron microscopyenergydispersive xray spectroscopy these findings suggest that lanthanum is absorbed in the stomach and transported via CL flow this observation could prove helpful in future investigation of lanthanum disposition
NIC,nicorandil,TS-3197,diabetic patients suffer from undesired IH T3 angioplasty NIC has a trend to reduce the rate of target lesion revascularization however whether NIC inhibits IH and the possible mechanisms underlying it remain to be determined we aimed at assessing the effect of NIC on IH in diabetic rats
CF,continuousflow,TS-3198,stroke is a L1 cause of mortality and longterm disability worldwide the study of biomarkers and pathogenesis is vital for early diagnosis and treatment of stroke in the present study a CF normalphasereversedphase 2DE liquid chromatographyquadrupole timeofflight mass spectrometry nprp d lcqtofms method was employed to measure lipid species in human plasma including HCs and lacunar infarction li patients as a result lipid species were demonstrated with significant difference between the two groups and a plasma biomarker model including glucosylceramide phosphatidylethanolamine free fatty acid and triacylglycerol was finally established this model was evaluated as an effective tool in that area under the receiver operating characteristic curve reached in the discovery set and in the validation set for diagnosing li patients from HCs besides the sensitivity and specificity of disease diagnosis in validation set were and at the best cutoff value respectively this T0 demonstrates the promising potential of nprp d lcqtofmsbased lipidomics RPA in finding biomarkers for disease diagnosis and providing special insights into the metabolism of stroke induced by SVD graphical abstract flowchart of the plasma biomarker MM establishment through biomarker screening and validation
AD,arrhythmogenic dose,TS-3199,the enhanced arrhythmogenic risk of combined treatment with CG and betasympathomimetics is referred in some textbooks but only a few detailed studies on in vivo models are available we therefore investigated this problem in conscious dogs in an intraindividual T0 we determined the dose of acetylstrophanthidin intravenous infusion of mcgkg per min which provoked ventricular premature beats with and without concomitant treatment with the partial betaagonistic EDC doxaminol mgkg po prenalterol or mgkg po or isoprenaline mcgkg per min in some dogs a PD was narrowed in order to reduce the coronary blood supply the arrhythmogenic dose of acetylstrophanthidin was nearly the same in all the groups investigated range from to mcgkg whereas the AD of acetylstrophanthidin was unchanged by betasympathomimetics the combination odence for polyclonal activation as measured by the number of immunoglobulinsecreting plaqueforming cells in the peripheral blood there was however a significant increase in the number of spontaneous plaqueforming cells in patients suffering from both iddm and hashimotos thyroiditis ht nonetheless immunoglobulin production T3 stimulation with pokeweed mitogen was not different in diabetics with or without ht when compared to normal controls these findings suggest that subtle changes in the immunoregulatory system occur during the early stages of iddm
FN,femoral nerve,TS-3200,we analyze a decoupled moran MM with haploid population size n a biallelic locus under mutation and drift with scaled forward and backward mutation rates Î¸Î¼n and Î¸Î¼n and directional selection with scaled strength Î³sn with small scaled mutation rates Î¸ and Î¸ which is AGA for single nucleotide polymorphism data in highly recombining regions we derive a simple approximate equilibrium CSD for polymorphic alleles with a constant of proportionality we also put forth an even simpler MM where all mutations originate from monomorphic states using this MM we derive the sojourn times conditional on the ancestral and fixed S2 and under equilibrium the distributions of fixed and polymorphic alleles and fixation rates furthermore we also derive the distribution of small samples in the diffusion limit and provide convenient recurrence relations for calculating this distribution this enables us to give formulas analogous to the ewenswatterson estimator of Î¸ for biased mutation rates and selection we applydy the spinal SN that constitute the lumbosacral plexus plexus lumbosacrales lsp and its distribution in chinchilla lanigera were investigated ten chinchillas males and females were used in this research the spinal SN that constitute the lsp were dissected and the distribution of pelvic limb nerves originating from the plexus was examined the iliohypogastric nerve arose from l and l giving rise to the cranial and caudal nerves and the ilioinguinal nerve arose from l the other CB of l gave rise to the genitofemoral nerve and CB from l gave rise to the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve the trunk formed by the union of l divided into medial femoral nerve and lateral branches obturator nerve it was found that the lsp was formed by all the ventral branches of l at l and s at s at the caudal part of the plexus a thick CB the ischiadic plexus was formed by contributions from l and s this root gave rise to the nerve branches which were disseminated to the posterior limb cranial and caudal gluteal nerves caudal cutaneous FN and ischiadic nerve the ischiadic nerve divided into the caudal cutaneous surae lateral cutaneous surae common fibular and tibial nerve the pudendal nerve arose from s and the other CB of s and s formed the rectal caudal nerve the results showed that the origins and distribution of spinal SN that constitute the lsp of chinchillas were similar to those of a few rodents and other mammals
PC,preconditioned,TS-3201,recent studies have shown a protection from CBF hypoxicischemic hi BB damage in the immature rat following a prior SVR hypoxic exposure when compared with those not exposed previously to investigate the mechanisms of hypoxic preconditioning BB glycogen and highenergy phosphate reserves were measured in naÃ¯ve and preconditioned rat pups subjected to hi groups in this T0 included untouched naÃ¯ve controls PC controls ie hypoxia only PC with hi insult and naÃ¯ve pups with hi insult hypoxic preconditioning was achieved in postnatalday rats subjected to systemic hypoxia for h at degrees c twentyfour hours later they were subjected to unilateral common carotid artery ligation and SVR hypoxia with oxygen at degrees c for min animals were allowed to recover from hi for up to h at TPS intervals animals in each group were frozen in liquid nitrogen for determination of cerebral metabolites preconditioned animals showed a significant increase in brain glycogen h following the initial hypoxic SE corresponding to the beginning of the hi insult measurement at the end of min of hi showed a SD of highenergy phosphates atp and phosphocreatine in all animals although atp remained significantly higher in the PC animals thus the energy from increased glycogen following preconditioning slowed highenergy phosphate depletion during hi thereby allowing for longterm protection
SE,staphylococcus epidermidis,TS-3202,the in vitro activity of cephalothin CEZ and vancomycin against isolates of methicillinresistant SE was determined by means of a BB dilution technique with two sizes of inoculum the size of the inoculum had a marked effect on the MIC concentrations and the minimal bactericidal concentrations of all three antibiotics with a small inoculum of the isolates were inhibited by micrograms of vancomycinml by micrograms of cephalothinml and by micrograms of cefazolinml with a large inoculum of the isolates were inhibited by micrograms of vancomycinml by micrograms of cephalothinml and by micrograms of cefazolinml as determined by a tube dilution checkerboard technique for both sizes of inoculum the combination of vancomycin plus cephalothin was synergistic against methicillinresistant s epidermidis in of cases and the combination of vancomycin plus CEZ was synergistic in or cases these data from in vitro studies suggest that these antibiotic combinations should be evaluated clinically in patients with severe infections caused by MR s epidermidis
LE,left ear,TS-3203,some investigators have found that words previously associated with shock elicit electrodermal responses edrs when presented in the nonattended channel of a DL task the present experiment tested for this phenomenon while closely monitoring for shifts in attention to the nonattended channel college student volunteers verbally shadowed a series of unrelated words presented to the attended channel while words made significant by previous association with shock and semantically related words were occasionally presented to the nonattended channel three principal findings were obtained fist when edrs were averaged across all trials and across all subjects it was found that edrs were elicited by the significant words presented in the nonattended channel second for the subgroup of subjects that had the significant words presented to the RA ear activating the left CBF hemisphere it was found that edrs were elicited by the significant words presented to the LE activating the RA cerebral hemisphere it was found that edrs were elicited by the significant word seven on trials on which there were no apparent shifts in attention the results of this T0 indicate the importance of closely controlling and monitoring for shifts in attention and suggest the potential importance of CBF laterality in mediating edrs to stimuli presented in a nonatttended channel
CT,conservative treatment,TS-3204,fortyfive patients men and women with an age range of to years median years were selected for a posterior thoracic percutaneous partial rhizotomy ppr based on the following criteria each patient had at least a month history of irradiating pain that followed the segmental DP of an IC nerve and had not responded to CT in addition no causal treatment was available and there was a temporary positive response to an IC blockade with lidocaine in the lower thoracic region t ppr was performed with the usual DL technique in the upper thoracic region a dorsal approach was used by means of a drill hole made with a kirschner wire in the vertebral arch the patients underwent thoracic ppr operations patients were evaluated months T3 treatment thirty patients were painfree in cases more than improvement was achieved and in four there was no improvement side effects consisting of a transient burning pain or a mild transient sensory loss occurred in eight patients after a followup period of to months median months results were evaluated in patients five patients had undergone reintervention excellent LT results were achieved in patients good results in and poor results in six it is concluded that when CT fails thoracic ppr may prove an effective and safe treatment for chronic segmental thoracic pain
HN,heymann nephritis,TS-3205,passive heymann nephritis a model of immune complex nephritis was produced in rats by injection of rabbit antibrush border membrane vesicle antibodies to examine the effect of treatment of epimembranous glomerulonephritis with dimethyl sulfoxide administration of dmso twice a day days a week for weeks significantly reduced protein excretion in the autologous phase of the MM this beneficial effect occurred in animals in which treatment was started a day C2 of the antibody and persisted for weeks after treatment was discontinued serum triglyceride concentrations were significantly decreased whereas bun serum cholesterol and AHG levels were significantly but not reproducibly reduced that dmso did not reduce proteinuria to normal values in rats treated T3 proteinuria was well established but was able to reduce proteinuria significantly treatment of normal rats and those with NTS nephritis did not reduce protein excretion glomeruli of rats with passive HN treated with dmso studied by immunofluorescent microscopy appeared to have less fluorescence for igg than control rats but these differences were not significant however c deposits were significantly decreased in treated rats but only during the first week of the disease and in vitro c fixation was also significantly reduced in glomeruli of rats that had been treated with dmso there was very little effect on SS complement activity ch was reduced only on day of treatment whereas the alternate pathway activity and SS c concentration were unaffected dmso may therefore reduce protein excretion in part by inhibiting cdependent PU these studies indicate that dmso is capable of significantly reducing protein excretion in rats with PHN and that its action may involve reduction of complement deposition within the glomeruli during the rat phase toxic effects included a mortality and decreased weight gain while being treated with larger doses of dmso treatment with a much smaller dose succeeded in reducing proteinuria significantly without affecting weight gain there was no evidence of druginduced CL or renal damage
FCA,freunds complete adjuvant,TS-3206,the pannus of rheumatoid ICA is a proliferating mass of various cells and tissues including follicles of lymphoid cels and is the L1 agent of destruction of the surrounding structural tissues infiltrating lymphocytes are thought to be the prime stimuli for the growth of the pannus through the secretion of of lymphokines in contrast to this high turnover destructive rheumatoid granuloma most commonly used exp granuloma models are of the nonimmune low turnover variety and thus give a rather poor reflection of clinical conditions a model has been developed in our laboratory in which lymph node cells are removed from FCA sensitized rats and injected into sponge implants in normal syngeneic recipient animals leading to enhancement of granuloma formation this response has been characterized and shown to be related to lymphocyte activation and to the sensitivity of rats to polyarthritis induction the lymphocyte transfer model may be useful in studying the action of drugs on lymphocyte mediated chronic inflammatory responses and the principle of lymphocyte transfer may be applied to other hypersensitivity granuloma models
CDA,cellulose diacetate,TS-3207,during haemodialysis the bloodmembrane contact causes a release of platelet granule content which contains plateletderived growth factor ab pdgfab in view of the potential role of this in altering biocompatibility during haemodialysis we evaluated the intra and postdialytic changes in pdgfab SS C2 during haemodialysis sessions performed with CDA cda and polysulfone ps CM respectively
SK,serum potassium,TS-3208,a year old female with primary aldosteronism and masked hyperaldosteronemia is reported her blood pressure was mmhg with no paralysis of hypokalemia SK aldosterone and renin activity were meql ngdl and ngmlh respectively following a stimulation test by sodium loading and furosemide plus standing neither aldosterone nor renin activity responded adrenal CT ultrasonography and cortical scintiscanning failed to reveal the tumor mass a definite diagnosis of aldosterone producing adenoma was made after adrenal venous sampling in which the concentration of aldosterone was fold greater in the right adrenal vein than in the left the diagnosis of RA adrenal cortical adenoma was confirmed by surgery thus this case indicates the usefulness of the sampling technique in making an accurate diagnosis for primary aldosteronism with normokalemia normoaldosteronemia and normoreninemia

ABC,aspiration biopsy cytology,TS-3211,ABC is an accurate safe innocuous alternative to excisional biopsy in diagnosing the nature of concomitant superficial nodules or lymphadenopathy in patients with known cutaneous malignancy in patients with penile CA aspiration biopsy cytology may avoid the morbidity and mortality of groin dissection staging a positive aspirate is conclusive of stage iii RT and in patients with occult nodal metastases may lead to early curative LA in the present study of patients with known CMM the ABC of superficial nodules resulted in a cytologic diagnosis of metastasis in nodules from patients in the management of patients with known melanoma the positive cytology of superficial nodules is conclusive of M1 and requires an accurate radiologic study to establish or exclude disseminated disease surgical removal of a M1 superficial nodule is indicated when the lesion is considered localized disease and the patient having been accurately examined is determined to be apparently free of disease in other CS and organs when systemic diffuse melanoma is found the excision of metastatic superficial nodules is unnecessary positive aspiration cytology may avoid risk from illjudged surgical procedures and indicate appropriate palliative treatment of the disease
LT,laryngeal tube,TS-3212,supraglottic airway devices are developed with increasing frequency following the overwhelming success of the LM airway lma currently the lma the proseal LMA plma the laryngeal tube lt the LT with integrated suctioning tube lts and the oesophageal tracheal combitube otc are the best evaluated and most widespread devices both the lma and the plma have been shown to be perfectly suitable for routine anaesthesia and emergency airway management while the lma is limited by the lack of reliable protection against aspiration the value of the plma in this respect remains undetermined yet lt and lts are primarily intended as emergency airway devices but have also been successfully used during controlled ventilation in adults the otc though advocated for emergency as well as routine use is limited by high airway morbidity and possible serious complications
CA,plasma catecholamines,TS-3213,in patients suffering from severe chronic aortic regurgitation ar NYHA PET class iii right atrial biopsies were taken during aortic valve replacement in these samples we determined the myocardial content of norepinephrine ne normetanephrine nm epinephrine e and dopamine da two to days before valve replacement CA were measured at rest and during IE fifteen patients with secundum atrial septal defect asd served as controls in patients with chronic ar who had no clinical signs of CF the myocardial content of ne p less than nm p less than and e p less than was significantly reduced compared with that in patients with asd the RA atrial content of da was not different in the two CG all patients had normal C2 of CA at rest during isometric exercise however the increase in plasma ne was significantly higher in patients with ar than in the control group p less than we conclude that patients with chronic ar who have an exaggerated increase in sympathetic activity during IE probably have a decrease in myocardial ne tissue content as well therefore clinical demonstration of a hyperadrenergic response during ISO exercise indicates alteration in myocardial metabolism in patients with severe chronic ar
LA,laparoscopic adrenalectomy,TS-3214,to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of LA with regard to adrenal mass size as well as to consider its clinical and pathologic patterns laparoscopy is today considered the firstchoice treatment of many adrenal diseases although its use is still controversial for C1 adrenal masses and incidentally found adrenal cortical carcinoma

HD,hodgkins lymphoma,TS-3216,for people IS by HIV virus hiv we expect an increase in CA incidence similar to that documented in SPK patients we examined the cancer spectrum in an HIV+ cohort specifically HM not currently associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids in relation to the GA population cancer incidence data for residents of harris county texas diagnosed between and were linked to hivaids registry data by soundex code and date of birth to identify malignancies in an HIV+ cohort of persons incidence of cancer in this cohort was compared to the GP by standardized incidence ratio sir analysis from the HIV+ cohort persons were identified as having one or more malignancies with occurring in males the linkage CT identified of the malignancies of which only were diagnosed in males adjusting for age HIV+ men and women had incidences of CA that were confidence interval ci and ci times that expected for the GA population of harris county texas besides kaposis sarcoma nonhodgkins lymphoma cervix cancer and BB lymphoma nonaids related malignancies of hodgkins lymphoma nonmelanotic skin CA in males and CC in females exhibited significant sirs of ci ci and ci increased incidences of lung prostate and breast malignancies were not seen in this hiv cohort persons infected with hiv appear to be at increased risk for the nonaids related malignancies HD nonmelanotic skin CA in males and CC in females
RI,radionuclide imaging,TS-3217,current trends in nuclear medicine to some degree at least reflect the level of sophistication available in the instrumentation a technologically oriented speciality such as this might be expected to shift emphasis from time to time as stepwise advances are made in instrumentation in its infancy NM concentrated on studies that could be accomplished with a singleprobe system the introduction of rectilinear scanners made imaging practical and of primary concern angers gamma camera made combined static and dynamic studies possible using a single instrumenta decided advantage over previous methodology the development of digital acquisition processing and display systems has had a profound effect on the recently increased emphasis on rapid dynamic studies computers are currently being applied to a broad range of clinical problems data preparation routines such as uniformity correction and data bounding often are used preliminary to more rigorous mathematical treatment the development of reasonably lowcost tvtype displays has greatly increased the SQ of the computer display of the RI process
AN,analgesic nephropathy,TS-3218,we examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the OD of AN in the gunn CS of rat the homozygous gunn rats have free hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuronyl GOT leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla these rats are also highly susceptible to develop PTC necrosis with analgesic administration we used homozygous jj and phenotypically normal heterozygous jj animals four groups of rats n were studied jjic aorta shunts that originate in either the LV or the PT aorta are generally viewed as hemodynamically similar despite incomplete documentation of their flow characteristics the present study was conducted to further define these hemodynamic properties MZ extraluminal shunts were placed from the left ventricular apex and aortic arch to the distal TA in mongrel dogs simultaneous pressure and doppler flow E/A were recorded in the carotid and femoral arteries computerenhanced composite waveforms were used to assist data analysis when compared to VVI cannulation aortic cannulation provided improved PT decompression and increased mean distal flow in addition significant diastolic flow reversal was recorded in the distal circulation when ventricular cannulation was employed on the other hand VVI cannulation was associated with the preservation of pulsatile flow whereas flow generated by aortic cannulation was linear it is concluded that extraluminal shunts that originate in the LV and the PT aorta have distinct hemodynamic properties these differences may be clinically important in specific situations
ST,scala tympani,TS-3219,the only method of hearing rehabilitation for patients with severe hypoacusis and peripheral deafness is cochlear implantation consisting of insertion of electrodes into the ST and direct electric impulse stimulation of the auditory nerve adjusted to the input acoustic signal only few such operations have been performed in this country much effort should be devoted to training of specialists and advocating this method among practitioners
PD,parkinsonian,TS-3220,a mutant mitochondrial dna mtdna with a bp deletion was detected in the PD BB by using the polymerase chain reaction although the deleted mtdna was detectable even in the brain of aged controls the proportion of deleted mtdna to normal mtdna in the striatum was higher in the PD patients than in the controls in both the PD patients and the aged controls the proportion was higher in the striatum than in the cerebral cortex these results indicate that agerelated accumulation of deleted mtdna is accelerated in the PD striatum and suggest that the deletion contributes to pathophysiological processes underlying FPD
CLP,cleft lip and palate,TS-3221,CLP patients can present with a maxillary retrusion with tendency to class iii malocclusion after cleft repair maxillary DO is a technique that provides simultaneous skeletal advancement and expansion of the soft tissues six nonsyndromic CL and palate patients ages to years mean years underwent maxillary distraction four had a unilateral and two a bilateral CLP after an incomplete lefort i osteotomy a LP of days was respected on postoperative day distraction was initiated through anterior traction on a delaire facial mask using distraction forces of gm photographs and lateral cephalometric radiographs were obtained preoperatively and months T3 distraction a cephalometric analysis was performed to compare the sagittal dentocraniofacial morphology before and T3 distraction the aesthetic improvement obtained by maxillary distraction osteogenesis during the permanent dentition to correct maxillary retrusion in our CL and palate patients was impressive skeletal advancement varying from to mm mean mm was found however significant dentoalveolar compensations occurred in three patients this was due to the dental anchorage of the distraction device and can be avoided only by the use of skeletal fixation

NC,normal control group,TS-3229,to determine the effect of left VVI and endocrine functions on linear growth in children with RHD rhd we studied children and adolescents with rhd over a period of year the mean sd for age of onset and duration of rhd were years and respectively the cardiac lesions were mitral incompetence n combined mitral and aortic incompetence n and mitral stenosis n growth was assessed by determining both height standard deviation scores htsds and GV standard deviation score gvsds every months and sexual maturity was assessed according to tanners criteria twohundred agematched normal children served as controls for the growth data endocrine evaluation was performed in the children with rhd who had age above years mean age years age and sexmatched NC and agematched children with constitutional delay of growth NVSS nvss circulating concentrations of estradiol e in girls testosterone t in boys and free t ft were measured growth hormone gh response to clonidine provocation lh and fsh response to lhrh stimulation and in boys testosterone t response to hcg were evaluated echocardiographic DUE of the left ventricular parameters was performed using a colourcoded echodoppler the htsds and gvsds of children with rhd were significantly lower than those for the NC delayed ON of puberty was evident in of the children with rhd and more had sexual maturity score below th percentile for age and gender in comparison with the agematched normal group those with rhd had significantly lower sexual maturity score v all the children had normal gh response to clonidine provocation and normal ft concentrations basal and hcg stimulated t concentrations were significantly low in adolescents with rhd and e C2 were nonsignificantly lower in girls with rhd compared to NCs lh response to lhrh was significantly decreased in rhd patients v controls denoting delayed maturation of the HP gonadal axis htsds and gvsds were correlated significantly with the left ventricular echocardiographic parameters including left VVI end DD lvedd r and respectively p left VVI end systolic diameter lvesd r and respectively p left VVI end diastolic volume lvedv r and respectively p left VVI end systolic volume lvesv r and respectively p peak velocity of circumferential MF vcf r and respectively p and with preejection periodejection time pepet r and respectively p it appears that linear growth of children with rhd without HR failure depends on the left VVI function in addition they have high incidence of delayed sexual OD secondary to delayed maturation of their hypothalamicpituitary gonadal axis
GM,gastrocnemius muscle,TS-3230,skeletal muscle gl oxidation is significantly reduced and alanine release enhanced in ADX after shortterm glucocorticoid treatment a possible site of regulation is the Pyr dehydrogenase complex pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was measured in vitro in extracts of the GM of normal adrenalectomized and shortterm glucocorticoid treated rats by the pnitroanilinearylamineacetyltransferase method and in situ in nonrecirculating perfusions of isolated hindlimbs with physiological pyruvate C2 and tracer doses of c pyruvate by measuring the offkinetic of co wash out in the effluent neither method showed a direct influence of GCs on skeletal muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase activity
ACC,adrenocortical carcinoma,TS-3231,the frequency of ACC was studied in a group of incidentally discovered adrenal tumours clinical characteristics were also analysed ultrasound scan and computed tomography were the main imaging techniques used hormonal examinations were also carried out the patients with an adrenal tumour diameter greater than or equal to cm and those with excess steroid production were recommended for surgery of patients treated with surgery ACC was diagnosed in cases the diameter of these tumours ranged between and cm the majority of these were hormonally inactive but in some cases increased corticosteroid secretion was noted in patients mitotane was administered following surgery with a good response in cases these cases were compared with a group of patients with clinically overt ACC
CA,condylomata acuminata,TS-3232,current developments in the technology of viral ID have rekindled interest in the relationship of human PVs CA and neoplasia although important observations are being reported in the female genital system the association of human papillomavirus and mucosal condylomata in male patients has not been well documented using the horseradish peroxidase technique and antisera to papillomaviruses viral antigens were identified in per cent of male patients with urethral CA the implications of this relationship are discussed briefly
BP,bovine pericardium,TS-3233,an experimental study to assess the performance of currently available pericardial substitutes is described with particular REF to their use T3 CABG seventytwo ewes six CG of animals had a x cm portion of the pericardium excised each group had either the defect left open primarily resutured replaced with coarse dexon no mesh american cyanamid co danbury conn replaced with fine dexon no mesh replaced with glutaraldehydepreserved bovine pericardium or replaced with polytetrafluoroethylene mm surgical membrane six animals from each group were assessed at months and the remaining six animals were assessed at months the opendefect and resutured groups served as control animals none of the substitutes proved superior to the opendefect group in the prevention of chest walllungtopericardium adhesions at either or months the limitations of the rat in assessing this aspect of substitute performance are discussed whereas the BP PTFE and dexon no mesh CG were superior to the resutured group in the prevention of pericardiumtoepithelium adhesions in the area of the patch this advantage was lost at months when resuturing proved as ERP as polytetrafluoroethylene and bovine pericardium in all CG there was little tendency to produce generalized pericardial adhesions at months dexon no mesh and BP produced the least amount of significant epicardial reaction in two animals in the month polytetrafluoroethylene group and in one animal in the month polytetrafluoroethylene group a fibrous peel was encountered on the inner surface of the patch which had also become adherent to the epicardium and had obscured the underlying anatomy at months the opendefect resutured and bovine pericardium groups had produced no significant Epi reaction in one animal at months the BP had become markedly thickened and degenerative we do not recommend routine closure of the pericardium T3 coronary i.a. operations with any of the substitutes investigated in our study
CAS,child assessment schedule,TS-3234,to explore the harter selfperception profile for adolescents sppa as an indicator of psychosocial outcome in adolescents with chronic PCS disorders we administered the questionnaire along with other wellestablished measures of psychosocial outcome the semistructured CAS cas interview and the youth self report ysr and child ABC cbcl questionnaires to one group of diseased adolescents with good psychosocial adjustment juvenile chronic arthritis jca and one with a high level of psychosocial maladjustment anorectal anomalies ara the adolescents with ara had signific instances of AR in patients and instances of no acute AAR normal n other processes n all pulmonary PC radiographic CA were assessed AR was associated with the presence of middle or lower lung Rt interstitial or airspace disease in lungs sensitivity this DP was seen in lungs without AR specificity there was no difference in the appearance of the lungs between grades and acute rejection normal lungs were noted in instances of AR the authors conclude that chest radiograph findings are abnormal in about of instances of biopsyproven AR because the appearance of acute AAR is similar to that of other conditions the diagnosis cannot be made accurately by chest radiography
ST,solid tumors,TS-3235,cytogenetic aberrations resulting in deletion of p are common in ST indicating the presence of tumor suppressor genes tsg on this chromosome arm the present T0 was undertaken to investigate p loss in hematologic disorders ten AML leukemias aml two myelodysplastic syndromes mds one philadelphia chromosomepositive chronic ML cml three ALL leukemias all one chronic lymphoproliferative disorder cld and three nonhodgkins lymphomas nhl with CA leading to p deletions were identified constituting of aml of mds of cml with changes in addition to t of all of cld and of nhl with cytogenetic CA analyzed at our department among karyotypically aberrant published cases of aml of mds of chronic myeloproliferative disorders cmd of cml with additional aberrations to t of all of cld of hodgkin disease hd and of nhl displayed partial loss of p p the majority occurring together with other abnormalities the frequencies of p loss did not differ significantly among the mds all and cld morphologic subgroups between b and t cell all cld and nhl among low intermediate and highgrade nhl or between therapyrelated mds and de novo mds whereas the incidence of p deletions was higher in treatmentassociated aml p than in de novo aml and varied among the aml fab groups p the most frequently deleted chromosome bands were p in aml p in mds p in cmd p p and p in cml p and p in all p and p in cld p in hd and p in nhl these deletion hot spots are more distal than those reported in most solid tumor types suggesting that different tsg are involved in hematologic HM and solid neoplasms
RP,retinyl palmitate,TS-3236,to characterize chylomicron remnant clearance by the liver plasma beta of retinyl palmitatelabeled chylomicron remnants was studied in HS ages years AP containing retinyl palmitatelabeled CMs and their remnants was injected intravenously and retinyl palmitate disappearance was measured in serial plasma samples in all subjects and in lipoprotein fractions in subjects the injected doses n ranged from to mumol retinyl palmitate in d less than or equal to gml particles with an average molar ratio of of retinyl palmitateapob n the label distributed in the intravascular space and exhibited apparent first order elimination monoexponential in and biexponential in subjects the first rapid component k t min n was shown to represent RP in particles of d less than or equal to gml ie chylomicron remnants and the second slow component k t min n small amounts of retinyl palmitate injected in d greater than gml particles therefore excluded from analysis assuming a singlecompartment model initial rates of elimination dose x k of labeled chylomicron remnants obeyed p MM saturation kinetics km was nmol retinyl palmitate label and vmax nmolmin corresponding to nm apob for km and x nmol apobming CL for vmax their beta was limited neither by the injected triglyceride dose nor theoretically by the CL blood flow T3 the intake of g of fat cream containing RP the plasma retinyl palmitate concentration exceeded the estimated saturation concentration for h in conclusion physiological chylomicron remnant catabolism by the liver appears to be saturable by ordinary lipid intake in healthy humans
CA,caucasian american,TS-3237,the current T0 investigated AF related to specific phobia domains and differences in patterns among african american and CA adults subjects were african americans and caucasian americans who completed the fear survey schedulesecond edition fssii fears related to TPS phobia domains were first examined with frequencies differing between african american and CA samples on three of the six TPS phobia domains a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to determine the patterns of specific phobias among the african american sample the trimmed MM for the african american sample included natural environment animal and social anxiety TPS phobia factors as latent exogenous variables data from the CA sample provided a poor fit to this model instead the trimmed model for the CA sahospital in several ways such as increasing revenues filling unused capacity and solidifying relationships with the physician and patient communities building rapport with physicians and the community ultimately brings economic value to the hospital to service this new market it is necessary to modify current systems and processes and develop new services the Az most likely to be developed are logistics service centers client services physician connectivity billing marketing sales and finance reporting developing efficient customerrelated services is a key to reaping the benefits
PR,panoramic radiography,TS-3238,the aim of this T0 was to determine the relationship between loss of radiographic crestal bone height in panoramic bitewing and periapical radiography and to probe the PAL T3 periodontal treatment radiographic and probing measurements were made at baseline and T3 one year the population in the study consisted of individuals females and males ages mean years a total of interproximal intrabony defects of mandibular first molar teeth treatments of which were planned by subgingival curettage procedures were selected from among subjects who had signed consent forms measurements of the distance between the cementoenamel junction and the alveolar crest were compared with probing crestal bone level and radiographic measurements before and one year T3 the procedures the results of probing pocket depths level before and one year T3 subgingival curettage were different with the mean average being mm these changes were statistically significant p bitewing radiography showed the highest accuracy among radiographic methods in the assessment of the crestal bone level mean average mm p there was only a slight mean difference compared to PR but this was statistically insignificant mean average mm p and the periapical radiography had the lowest accuracy of radiographic methods changed mean average mm p in summary we can say that both bitewing and PR are preferred to periapical images for crestal bone assessment
IR,information retrieval,TS-3239,qualitative systematic reviews or qualitative evidence syntheses qes are increasingly recognised as a way to enhance the value of systematic reviews srs of clinical trials they can explain the mechanisms by which interventions evaluated within trials might achieve their effect they can investigate differences in effects between different population CG they can identify which outcomes are most important to patients carers health professionals and other stakeholders qes can explore the impact of acceptance feasibility meaningfulness and implementationrelated factors within a real world setting and thus contribute to the design and further refinement of future interventions to produce valid reliable and meaningful qes requires systematic ID of relevant qualitative evidence although the methodologies of qes including methods for IR are welldocumented little empirical evidence exists to inform their conduct and reporting
PP,postprandial,TS-3240,lipopolysaccharide lps may play an important role in chronic diseases through the activation of inflammatory responses the type of diet consumed is of major concern for the prevention and treatment of these diseases evidence from animal and human studies has shown that lps can diffuse from the gut to the circulatory system in response to the intake of high amounts of fat the method by which lps move into the circulatory system is either through direct diffusion due to intestinal paracellular permeability or through absorption by enterocytes during chylomicron secretion considering the impact of metabolic diseases on public health and the association between these diseases and the C2 of lps in the circulatory system this review will mainly discuss the current knowledge about highfat diets and subclinical inflammation it will also describe the new evidence that correlates gut microbiota IP and ALP phosphatase activity with increased blood lps levels and the biological effects of this increase such as insulin resistance although the majority of the studies published so far have assessed the effects of dietary fat additional studies are necessary to deepen the understanding of how the amount the SQ and the structure of the fat may affect endotoxaemia the potential of food combinations to reduce the negative effects of fat intake should also be considered in future studies in these studies the effects of flavonoids prebiotics and probiotics on endotoxaemia should be investigated thus it is essential to identify dietetic strategies capable of minimising endotoxaemia and its PP inflammatory effects

CP,cationic proteins,TS-3242,the development of synthetic processes for oxide nanomaterials is an issue of considerable topical interest while a number of chemical methods are available and are extensively used the collaborations are often energy intensive and employ toxic chemicals on the other hand the synthesis of inorganic materials by biological systems is characterized by processes that occur at close to ambient temperatures and pressures and at neutral ph examples include magnetotactic bacteria diatoms and slayer bacteria here we show that nanoparticulate magnetite may be produced at room temperature extracellularly by challenging the fungi fusarium oxysporum and verticillium sp with mixtures of ferric and ferrous salts extracellular hydrolysis of the anionic iron complexes by CP secreted by the fungi results in the roomtemperature synthesis of crystalline magnetite particles that exhibit a signature of a ferrimagnetic transition with a negligible amount of spontaneous magnetization at LT
DC,dichorionic,TS-3243,the aim was to determine whether discordant twin growth has an impact on PTB in dichorionic pregnancies this retrospective study included DC twin pregnancies in the period from january to december the following variables were investigated maternal age years parity body mass index kgm week â\x89¤ and â\x89¥ and mode of delivery vaginal and cesarean section birth weight grams and apgar score â\x89¤ discordant twin growth in dichorionic pregnancies was found to be associated with PTB Ï\x87 p but had no impact on the mode of delivery Ï\x87 p there was a statistically significant difference in the rate of small for gestational age sga neonates Ï\x87 p and apgar score Ï\x87 p between the T0 CG mode of conception in DC pregnancies was not a risk factor for preterm delivery Ï\x87 p in conclusion discordant twin growth in dichorionic pregnancies is a risk factor for PT delivery and has no impact on the mode of delivery but has an impact on the rate of sga and apgar score
RP,roller pump,TS-3244,the isolated left lower lobes of dogs lungs were perfused by means of a RP with blood at hematocrit values ranging from to per cent pressureflow curves were constructed at blood flow rates from one half to three times the normal flow for the left lower lobe at each hematocrit level the perfusion pressure was normalized with reference to the normal hematocrit to per cent and normal blood flow for the left lower lobe ml per kilogram per minute from these normalized pressureflow curves normalized resistanceflow curves were constructed at different mean hematocrit levels regression lines were drawn relating normalized pulmonary V1 resistance to hematocrit at different rates of pulmonary blood flow which might be found in patients with congenital HR disease it was found that pulmonary V1 resistance rose in an exponential fashion as the hematocrit was increased and that the blood viscosity determined both the shape of the resistanceflow curve and magnitude of the increase in resistance to pulmonary blood flow especially when the pulmonary blood flow was less than normal and the hematocrit was greater than per cent the family of regression lines relating pulmonary V1 resistance to hematocrit at different flow rates may be used clinically in patients with congenital HR disease and polycythemia to determine if an elevated pulmonary V1 resistance is due to increased blood viscosity or obstructive pulmonary V1 disease it is concluded that an increased BV due to polycythemia significantly alters the pulmonary hemodynamics of patients with congenital HR disease with either increased or decreased pulmonary blood flow increased blood viscosity may play an important part in the early initiation and OD of pulmonary arteriosclerosis in patients with transposition of the great arteries

IP,inphase,TS-3246,the directed tocsy PP CS element transfers coherence predominantly into forwarddirected antiphase coherences while simultaneously suppressing IP and backwarddirected antiphase coherences this novel selection principle based on the direction of the target coherences provides a new approach for the simplification of crowded spectra in this article the theory of directed tocsy is presented for linear spin systems that are frequently found in carbonlabeled biomolecules
CSP,competencestimulating peptide,TS-3247,atpsensitive potassium katp channels are an essential component of glucosedependent insulin secretion in pancreatic islet betacells these channels comprise the sulfonylurea receptor sur and kir a member of the inward rectifier k channel family mutations in the sur S1 are associated with HI hi mim an inherited disorder characterized by hyperinsulinism in the neonate since the kir gene maps to HSA p which also encompasses a locus for hi we screened the kir gene for the presence of mutations in hi probands by singlestrand conformation polymorphism sscp and nucleotide sequence analyses a nonsense mutation tyrstop at codon designated yx was observed in the homozygous state in a single proband rb efflux measurements and singlechannel recordings of crement of s pneumoniae for zn and mn the addition of zn also restored nearnormal spontaneous transformation of adc mutant cells in standard transformation medium zn was found to be specifically required soon after contact of cells with the CSP revealing an unsuspected need for zn in transformation of s pneumoniae the removal of mn from standard transformation medium also resulted in transformation deficiency of psaa mutant cells taken together these results lead us to propose that adc is an abctype zn permease the first such protein complex identified in any organism and that psa is an abctype mn permease complex
RP,red pulp,TS-3248,the leukocyte Int gene cdd is expressed predominantely on subsets of the myelomonocytic lineage myeloid cells particularly on macrophage foam cells and splenic RP macrophages its expression DP clearly differs from myeloidspecific leukocyte integrins cdb and cdc and the leukocytespecific Int cda although the functions of cdd have not been determined in any detail its expression in these cell types suggests that it may play a role in the AS process to better understand how this gene is regulated the steadystate level of cdd mrna in differentiating bone marrow cdcd cells peripheral blood monocytes and monocytic cell lines was assessed by northern blot analysis and rtpcr and compared with those of cda cdb and cdc expression of cdd occurs early in cdcd cells rises and then decreases in contrast to the expression of the other leukocyte integrins expression of cdd reappears in peripheral blood monocytes differentiating to macrophage foam cells Ox lipoproteins oxldl and acetylated lipoproteins acldl failed to upregulate cdd following differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes or the monocytic cell line hl however when both oxldl and acldl were present during differentiation cdd was further upregulated this suggests that expression of cdd is coordinately regulated with expression of ldl receptors and the OD of the foam cell SDM of the to region of the cdd promoter revealed transcription factor binding CS essential for expression of this gene decoy oligonucleotides to the to region taken up by cdcd cells block their differentiation into myeloid colonies this suggests that one or more transcription AF that regulate cdd also are essential for myeloid differentiation and that the cdd promoter may be usedokine expression recruitment and activation of antigenpresenting cells modulation of regulatory cytokines subsequent differentiation of th cells isotype switching and stimulation of crosspriming the heterogeneity of rnaassociated motifs results in differential binding to cellular receptors and specifically impacts the immune profile naturally occurring dsRNA dsrna triggered activation of dendritic cells and enhancement of TPS immunity similar to selected synthetic dsrna motifs based on the ability of TPS rna motifs to block tolerance induction and effectively organize the immune defense during viral infection we conclude that such rna species are potent danger motifs we also demonstrate the feasibility of using selected rna motifs as adjuvants in the context of novel aerosol carriers for optimizing the immune response to subunit vaccines in conclusion rnaassociated motifs produced during viral infection bridge the early response with the late adaptive phase regulating the activation and differentiation of antigenspecific b and TA in addition to a ST impact on innate immunity
DMA,dynamic mechanical analysis,TS-3249,thiolclick reactions lead to polymeric materials with a wide range of interesting mechanical electrical and optical properties however this reaction mechanism typically results in bulk materials with a low glass transition temperature tg due to rotational flexibility around the thioether linkages found in networks such as thiolene thiolepoxy and thiolacrylate systems this report explores the thiolmaleimide reaction utilized for the first time as a solventfree reaction system to synthesize hightg thermosetting networks through thermomechanical characterization via DMA the homogeneity and tg s of thiolmaleimide networks are compared to similarly structured thiolene and thiolepoxy networks while preliminary data show more heterogeneous networks for thiolmaleimide systems bulk materials exhibit tg s Â°c higher than other thiolclick systems explored herein finally hollow tubes are synthesized using each thiolclick reaction mechanism and employed in low and hightemperature environments demonstrating the ability to withstand a compressive radial n deformation at Â°c wherein other thiolclick systems fail mechanically
MA,microscopic agglutination,TS-3250,in spite of the fact that the serology and particularly the microscopic agglutination technique are the most recommended methods to diagnose leptospirosis they frequently fail in the diagnosis of individual cases and in outbreaks where the diagnosis is frequently made postmortem by argentic and immunohistochemical impregnation these techniques are also unable to diagnose chronic leptospirosis since the antibody titres are very low or in it due to this fact and to the need of a reliable and AGA lab diagnosis a comparative T0 of dark field videorecording supported by argentic impregnation and immunohistochemistry in blood and urine was conducted against a serology by MA technique in patients with chronic leptospirosis dark field videorecording argentic impregnation and immunohistochemistry proved to be be much more sensible than the MA technique in addition to be comparable among themselves we recommended videorecording to achieve a fast early and economical diagnosis particularly if we associate it with immunohistochemistry or argentic impregnation likewise in the SC of these samples strains of of positive primoculture were obtained and an electronic microphotography was possible to attain in the IP blood of one of the studied cases which guarantees the study and confirms the existence of chronic leptospirosis

SC,administered subcutaneously,TS-3277,osteogenesis imperfecta oi is a rare hereditary skeletal disease leading to recurrent fractures SS and impaired mobility the phenotype varies from mildly affected patients to perinatal lethal forms in most cases an impaired collagen production due to mutations in cola or cola cause this hereditary bone fragility syndrome with an autosomal dominant inheritance currently an interdisciplinary therapeutic approach with antiresorptive drugs physiotherapy and surgical procedures is the state of the art therapy the effect of such a therapy is evaluated by measuring different surrogate parameters like areal bone mineral density or by using different mobility tests or questionnaires up till now the impact of these parameters on SQ of life of the patients is not evaluated currently pharmacological strategies are based on antiresorptive treatment with bisphosphonates in this trial we investigated the effect of an antiresorptive therapy with the monoclonal antibody denosumab decreasing the activity of osteoclasts denosumab was SC in a dose of mgkg body weight in children with oi years of age every weeks for weeks areal bone mineral density mobility pain scores and quality of life were measured the results showed a good effect of the treatment on bone mineral density but this improvement showed no correlation to pain and quality of life in conclusion further trials have to define parameters to assess interventions which influence ADL of the patients an interdisciplinary RPA including physicians basic researchers and patient organisation is needed to focus research on topics improving quality of life of patients with severe skeletal diseases
NB,nile blue,TS-3278,covalent immobilization of redoxactive dyes is an important strategy to evaluate structureactivity relationships in nanoscale electrochemistry by using optical readouts such as surfaceenhanced raman scattering sers here we investigate the role of the tether length in the sers spectroelectrochemistry of surfaceattached NB differential pulse voltammetry and a potentialdependent sers derivative analysis reveal that the nile blue molecules adopt a different orientation with respect to the electrode surface as the number of carbons in a carboxylic acidterminated alkanethiol ML is varied which leads to unique sers spectroelectrochemical behaviors we use the relative clearly defined for most pathogens salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium is not only a leading cause of human gastroenteritis in highincome countries but is also one of the main causes of invasive nontyphoidal salmonellosis ints in middle and lowincome countries the incidence of nontyphoidal salmonellosis is increasing worldwide causing millions of infections and deaths among humans each year regrettably antimicrobial resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics is common among nontyphi salmonella strains therefore the OD of vaccines targeting this leading invasive pathogen is warranted in the present T0 we have identified the om protein profile of the virulent s typhimurium strain sl by means of sarkosyl SE
TP,tea polyphenols,TS-3279,it has been suggested that proteasome activity is essential for RT cell proliferation and DR development we have previously shown that natural and synthetic ester bondcontaining TP are selective inhibitors of the chymotrypsinlike activity of the proteasome the most abundant catechin in green tea is epigallocatechingallate egcg which has been found by many laboratories to exhibit the most potent anticancer activity we have reported that egcg is also the most effective proteasome inhibitor among all the natural GTC tested unfortunately egcg is very unstable in neutral and alkaline conditions in an attempt to increase the stability and thus the tau we synthesized several egcg analogs with acetyl protected oh CG as prodrugs here we report for the first time that these acetylated synthetic tea analogs are much more potent than NK egcg in inhibiting the proteasome in cultured tumor cells consistently these protected analogs showed much higher potency than egcg to inhibit proliferation and transforming activity and to induce apoptosis in human leukemic prostate breast and simian virus transformed cells additionally these protected analogs had greatly reduced effects on human normal and nontransformed cells therefore these peracetate protected tea polyphenols are more efficacious than egcg and possess great potential to be developed into novel anticancer drugs identification of the cytosolic metabolites of peracetateprotected polyphenols in cultured RT cells and examination of their in vivo tumor growthinhibitory activity are currently underway in our laboratory
EM,eye movement,TS-3280,recent studies have shown that participants use different EM strategies when scanning own and otherrace faces however it is unclear whether this effect is related to face recognition performance and to what extent this effect is influenced by topdown or bottomup facial information in the present study chinese participants performed a face recognition task with chinese caucasian and racially ambiguous faces for the racially ambiguous faces we led participants to believe that they were viewing either ownrace chinese faces or otherrace caucasian faces results showed that chinese participants scanned the nose of the true chinese faces more than that of the true caucasian faces whereas they scanned the eyes of the caucasian faces more than those of the chinese faces they scanned the eyes nose and mouth equally for the ambiguous faces in the chinese condition compared with those in the caucasian condition when recognizing the true chinese target faces but not the true target caucasian faces the greater the fixation proportion on the nose the faster the participants correctly recognized these faces the same was true when racially ambiguous face stimuli were thought to be chinese faces these results provide the first evidence to show that visual scanning patterns of faces are related to ownrace face recognition response time and it is bottomup facial physiognomic information that mainly contributes to face scanning however topdown knowledge of racial categories can influence the relationship between face scanning patterns and recognition response time
EM,electronmicroscopy,TS-3281,gastric biopsy materials of consecutive japanese patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy were reviewed along with those of patients with helicobacter heilmannii infection chronic gastritis four mucosaassociated LT malt lymphoma in four patients with h heilmannii infection the materials were examined by transmission EM urea breath test three patients and antibody test five patients were performed in patients with h heilmannii infection in two patients with malt lymphoma h heilmannii was eradicated the prevalence of h heilmannii was in the consecutive series in chronic gastritis the GM was endoscopically normal had erythema or had erosions histologically it showed no epithelial NC mild MNC infiltration and slight and focal neutrophil infiltration helicobacter heilmannii was positive with antih pylori antibody and was detected in the mucous gel SL and in foveolae in malt lymphoma the gastric mucosa was coarsely granular with enlarged mucosal folds without ulcers two cases with small ulcers one case or with multiple erosions one case urea breath test and antibody test were both negative eradication of h heilmannii resulted in remission of malt lymphoma helicobacter heilmannii infection is therefore uncommon in japanese adults but is associated with chronic gastritis and gastric malt lymphoma
TF,mtctetrofosmin,TS-3282,the aim of the study was to quantitatively compare the scintigraphic images of the thyroid and abnormal parathyroid glands obtained with technetiumm tetrofosmin and thallium in patients with HP fortysix patients with hyperparathyroidism underwent tl mbq mtcpertechnetate mbq and mtctetrofosmin mbq scintigraphy in a single session image analysis included the computation of the thyroidbackground ratio in the whole study population and the parathyroidbackground ratio parathyroidthyroid ratio and diagnostic sensitivity in patients who underwent parathyroid surgery the pertechnetate subtraction technique was used tl and TF showed a similar thyroidbackground ratio and respectively pns however TF showed a higher parathyroidbackground ratio than tl vs p despite the superior SQ of TF images both tracers showed identical sensitivity in detecting enlarged parathyroid glands in HPT and in those with secondary HP
IC,invasive cancer,TS-3283,barretts esophagus highgrade dysplasia hgd and IC are steps in the progression of esophageal adenocarcinoma while surgery is recommended for resectable invasive adenocarcinoma a number of treatment modalities are advocated for hgd the purpose of this study is to determine the outcomes after surgery for hgd
ID,primary immunodeficiency,TS-3284,routine exercise has been established as an ERP way to improve overall health the value of exercise has been established in many diseases however there are no studies investigating the impact of exercise for individuals with ID disease pid the purpose of this study was to investigate exercise perceptions and behaviors in individuals diagnosed with pid
RI,regular insulin,TS-3285,the concentration of reducing sugar in the urine is commonly used in the management of diabetes in children supplemental doses of RI are administered in response to the concentration of urine sugar according to a protocol termed the sliding scale this practice assumes that the concentration of sugar in urine is a good indicator of the PG concentration this assumption was tested by comparing urine sugar concentrations in first and second voided urines with the PG concentrations in children with diabetes the correlation was good r for both the first and second voided urine specimens thus urine sugar concentrations in general define the level of PG the large standard deviation of the PG at each concentration of urine sugar however limits the usefulness of urine sugar as an accurate reflection of the coincident plasma gl concentration the urine sugar concentration although useful for the GA management of diabetes provides significant risk when used to guide frequent adjustments in insulin administration therefore the sliding scale should not be used in the treatment of children with diabetes
ES,endostatin,TS-3286,it has been reported that an endostatinderived synthetic peptide named es that contains the amino acids of ES from its n terminus efficiently inhibits basic FB growth factorinduced directional migration and tubular morphogenesis of microvascular endothelial cells we found that the peptide had no effects on tumor growth in vivo however when the peptide argglyasp rgd was introduced into es the modified es showed significant antitumor results in animal models histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis showed that rgdmodified es induced C1 Az of continuous necrosis within PT and significantly reduced the vessel density compared to control furthermore only the MMP with rgd were able to bind tumor cells in vitro suggesting that additional rgd domains may help in improving the receptorbinding ability and pharmacokinetic properties of es and preventing organic clearance as well as enzymatic Kd of the peptide thus enabling a greater fraction of the administered dose to be biologically available
LA,left atria,TS-3287,although the positive inotropic effect of CG correlates well with inhibition of na pump activity in many preparations digitalis at low concentrations to m may produce an apparent stimulation of monovalent cation transport in isolated intact myocardium or produce an inotropic effect that does not correlate with pump inhibition digitalis is known to modify tissue metabolism of endogenous neurotransmitters that may affect inotropic state nakatpase activity and k permeability we examined the interactions of low concentrations of ouabain with adrenergic and ACh influences in isolated guinea pig LA stimulated at hz in which inotropic state and monovalent cation transport measured as rb uptake were assessed simultaneously ouabain m stimulated rb transport without an inotropic response the stimulatory effect on transport was abolished by propranolol or atropine pretreatment in atria pretreated with atropine m ouabain produced a small PIE without measurable associated nak pump inhibition this inotropic response was abolished in catecholaminedepleted atria ouabain m always produced a positive inotropic response about independent of catecholamine SD betaadrenergic blockade or muscarinic blockade but rb uptake inhibition was observed only in betaadrenergicallyblocked atria in all preparations ouabain concentrations greater than m caused an inotropic response associated with pump inhibition at concentrations x m and higher mechanical toxicity was observed in all S9 except those pretreated with propranolol incubation with low concentrations of ouabain did not modify the inotropic response to isoproterenol at concentrations of isoproterenol sufficient to stimulate rb transport by there was a large inotropic response we conclude first that in guinea pig atria exposed to ouabain the mechanism as well as the extent of inotropic response and of monovalent cation transport modification is concentration dependent second that at low concentrations x m in vitro inotropic and monovalent cation transport responses are in part mediated by an effect of ouabain on endogenous neurotransmitters and third that in this preparation at concentrations between and m ouabain monovalent cation transport as measured by tissue rb uptake does not correlate with inotropic response
AD,axillary dissection,TS-3288,SN sln biopsy in breast CA allows for a more thorough pathologic assessment with serial sectioning and cytokeratin staining this has resulted in increased detection of micrometastatic disease RT size mm in the sln unfortunately the value of completion AD T3 finding micrometastatic disease in the sln remains poorly defined over a year period a prospective database of patients who underwent sln biopsy for breast CA at baylor university medical center was reviewed eightyfour of the patients had evidence of M1 in the sln twentyfour of the patients identified as having micrometastatic disease in the sln underwent completion axillary lymph node dissection in these patients all nonsentinel NO were further studied by serial sectioning and immunohistochemistry the median age of these patients was years range their primary tumor stages were ta and tb n tc n and t n a total of nonsentinel CL nodes were examined including from patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma n and from patients with ILC n in the patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma no additional nodal metastases were identified while in those with infiltrating lobular carcinoma additional nodal disease was found in CL nodes of patients primary RT characteristics were not predictive of additional nodal disease these data suggest that patients with micrometastasis in the sln from ILC have a significant risk of harboring additional nodal disease and should undergo completion axillary dissection however those with micrometastatic disease from infiltrating ductal carcinoma have a very low incidence of additional metastasis and may not need completion axillary dissection
SI,selfincompatibility,TS-3289,many angiosperms employ SI systems to prevent inbreeding the simple genetics of such systems have made them attractive models of plant cellular communication implicit in the single locus genetics is that only one or a few gene products are necessary for recognition and AAR of incompatible pollen results in the sporophytic system of the brassicaceae suggest that different slocus products are responsible for the pollen and pistil parts of the recognition and rejection response in solanaeceous plants which have a gametophytic SI system the s locus product responsible for the pollen portion of the interaction has not been identified but ribonucleases encoded by the slocus srnases are strongly implicated in the style part of the recognition and rejection reaction in nicotiana alata pollen recognition and AAR occur if its sallele matches either sallele in the style the putative stylar srnase is abundant in the transmitting tract and pollen rejection may be related to action of srnase on pollen rnas efforts to understand the molecular basis for pollen recognition and rejection have been limited by the lack of a system for manipulating and expressing srnases here we use the promoter of a styleexpressed gene from tomato to obtain high levels of srnase expression in transgenic nicotiana recognition and AAR of n alata pollen salleles occur faithfully in the transgenic plants our results show that srnases alone are sufficient for pollen rejection in this system
GF,gel filtration,TS-3290,the survival of cerebrocortical neurons from to dayold chick embryos was investigated in a SF hormonesupplemented medium the addition of cerebral extract promoted the survival of cortical SN in a dosedependent manner but induced almost no neurite outgrowth the trophic activity was higher in the AD cerebrum than in the embryonic cerebrum the tropic factor was partially purified from AD chicken cerebrum and the molecular weight of the factor was estimated to be about kda the activity for survival factor was fairly resistant to heat or TR treatment when the partially purified sample was however treated with TR mgml for h and applied to a tsk g sw GF column the activity moved from to kda untreated AS fractions to fractions with about kda these physicochemical properties of the survival factor suggest a new class of macromolecular trophic AF in the brain
SP,seminal plasma,TS-3291,the effects of human SP hsp and prostaglandin e pge on the proliferative responses of human splenic lymphocytes and IP blood mononuclear cells pbmcs to phytohaemagglutinin pha anticd and anticd plus anticd mab have been studiedvical neoplasia
LC,liquid crystalline,TS-3292,we study the phase diagram and orientational ordering of guest LC lc rods immersed in a quenched host made of a liquid crystalline polymer lcp matrix with mobile side chains the lcp matrix lies below the glass transition of the polymer backbone the side chains are mobile and can align to the guest rod molecules in a plane normal to the local lcp chain contour a field theoretic formulation for this system is proposed and the effects of the lcp matrix on lc ordering are determined numerically we obtain simple analytical equations for the nematicisotropic phase diagram boundaries our calculation show a nematicnematic nn first order transition from a guest stabilized to a guesthost stabilized region and the possibility of a reentrant transition from a guest stabilized nematic region to a host only stabilized regime separated by an isotropic phase a detailed study of thermodynamic variables and interactions on orientational ordering and phases is carried out and the relevance of our predictions to experiments and computer simulations is presented
NS,novelty seeking,TS-3293,adrenaline is a fundamental circulating hormone for bodily responses to internal and external stressors BCC of the adrenal medulla am represent the main NE adrenergic component and are believed to differend with bn with gd sud and patients with bn sud various assessment instruments were po as well as other clinical measures to evaluate their predictive capacity results marked differences in personality traits were observed between CG NS harm avoidance SD cooperation and selftranscendence best differentiated the groups notably NS was significantly higher in the two dual pathology subgroups patients with dual pathology showed the most dysfunctional personality profiles discussion and conclusion our results indicate the existence of shared dysfunctional personality traits among the groups studied especially in novelty seeking and selfdirectedness
LM,light microscope,TS-3294,several authors have proposed that hypocalcemia can interfere with amelogenesis resulting in enamel aberrations therefore the purpose of this investigation was to study the effects of a dietinduced hypocalcemic state in young rats on enamel formation of the maxillary incisors the exp rats were fed a special diet free from vitamin d and very low in calcium the control rats were fed a ND the exp period was wk T3 termination the blood analysis showed that the exp rats had developed hypocalcemia with very low values of both total and ionized blood calcium the experimental rats were smaller than their controls T3 wk with smaller skulls and teeth at the LM level the enamel and the ameloblasts did not seem to be affected except in one rat the smallest which showed enamel hypoplasias in both maxillary incisors and a delayed increase of the mineral content during the maturation stage process it is concluded that the hypocalcemic state induced did not greatly affect enamel formation however occasional enamel aberrations may occur
ICC,invasive cervical carcinoma,TS-3295,a total of new patients underwent colposcopic evalution in the dysplasia clinic at nassau county medical center of these patients had abnormal papanicolaou smears associated with pregnancy were referred because of in utero SE to diethylstilbestrol and were referred because of abnormal cervical cytologic smear or suspicious C2 or vaginal lesion further analysis of this latter group revealed that patients had satisfactory colposcopic evaluation and directed biopsy showed the following cases of ICC of carcinoma in situ with microinvasion of cervical carcinoma in situ of severe dysplasia and cases of mild to moderate C2 dysplasia all of these patients subsequently were treated accordingly evaluation of final histologic specimen revealed a very high correlation with colposcopically guided biopsies in patients where colposcopic evaluation was unsatisfactory diagnostic cold knife conization was performed final histologic diagnosis disclosed a more advanced lesion in patients or of this group the result of this T0 shows that satisfactory colposcopic evaluation is a highly accurate method of DUE of abnormal cervical and vaginal cytologic smear
CS,cavernous sinus,TS-3296,Fn glue i.t. has been used to control intraoperative CS cs venous bleeding there have been no reported complications related to this maneuver we present a case where a patient developed a sensory TG nerve deficit T3 i.t. of FG into the posterior cs during resection of a petrosal meningioma we believe that this deficit was due to the compression of the TG ganglion similar to balloon compression procedures although Fn glue injection may achieve satisfactory CS homeostasis the volume and rate of i.t. should be kept in mind to avoid a compressive lesion on traversing cranial nerves and surrounding structures or retrograde filling of the A-V tributaries
AS,stress,TS-3297,mutations in cuzn superoxide dismutase sod are one of the genetic causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als although the primary symptom of als is muscle weakness the link between sod mutations cellular dysfunction and muscle atrophy and weakness is not well understood the purpose of this study was to characterize cellular markers of er AS in skeletal muscle across the lifespan of gasod alstg mice muscles were obtained from alstg and agematched wild type wt mice at d presymptomatic d and d symptomatic and analyzed for er AS markers in white gastrocnemius wg muscle er AS sensors perk and ireÎ± were upregulated fold at d and remained perk or increased further ireÎ± at d phosphoeifÎ± a downstream target of perk and an inhibitor of protein translation was increased by d and increased further to fold at d ireÎ± upregulation leads to increased splicing of xbox binding protein xbp to the xbps isoform xbps transcript was increased at d and d indicating activation of ireÎ± signaling the er chaperoneheat shock protein grpbip was upregulated fold at d and d and increased to fold by d the erstressspecific apoptotic signaling protein chop was upregulated fold at d and d and increased to fold at d indicating progressive activation of an AI signal in muscle there was a greater increase in grpbip and chop in wg vs the more oxidative RG rg alstg at d indicating greater er AS and apoptosis in fast glycolytic muscle these data show that the er stress response is G1 in skeletal muscle of alstg mice by an early presymptomatic age and increases with PD these data suggest a mechanism by which myocellular er AS leads to reduced protein translation and contributes to muscle atrophy and weakness in als
FP,family practice,TS-3298,we conducted a mail survey of practicing FPs FP faculty and FP residents in both rural and urban nebraska concerning their perceptions of core procedures in FM and their perceived competency in performing them final response rate was there was GA agreement concerning what constituted the core procedures in family medicine although several newer procedures such as flexible sigmoidoscopy provoked more controversy rural physicians were more likely to classify intrauterine device insertion endometrial biopsy and C2 biopsy as core procedures than their urban counterparts as expected whether a physician performed a procedure related directly to his reported competence in performing it however there were discrepancies between perceived training during residency and current practice for control of nasal hemorrhage aspiration of breast mass flexible sigmoidoscopy EB and joint aspiration faculty programs for teaching procedural skills standards for documenting competence and systems for ongoing SQ assurance should be further developed
IPS,inferior petrosal sinus,TS-3299,diagnosing cushings syndrome is challenging and is further hampered when investigations are performed in a patient with cyclic cushings syndrome a subset of CS exhibit periods of abnormal cortisol secretion with interspersed normal secretion patients can have periods of clinical improvement during these quiescent phases or remain symptomatic initial diagnostic testing can be challenging because of the unpredictable durations of the peak and trough phases and it is especially challenging when the diagnosis of cyclic cushings syndrome has not yet been determined here the authors present the case of a patient with cushings disease with a pathologyproven ACTH acthsecreting pituitary adenoma and whose initial IPS sampling ipss results were deemed indeterminate further studies elucidated the diagnosis of cyclic cushings syndrome repeat ipss was diagnostic of a CE source for acth secretion and the patient was treated successfully with transsphenoidal resection literature concerning the diagnosis and management of cyclic cushings syndrome is also reviewed
BT,behavior therapy,TS-3300,the obesity epidemic has been recognized in the professional and lay public as a major health problem in the united states and many other cultures the GI literature has recently paid attention to this problem focusing primarily on either physiological mechanisms of obesity or surgical remedies for obesity however behavioral strategies developed from social learning theory have been the most thoroughly tested interventions for the treatment of obesity as well as the interventions shown most clearly to have clinical benefit nevertheless descriptions of behavioral techniques and their theoretical underpinnings have been minimal in the GI literature here a brief PH and presentation of the theoretical underpinnings of behavioral strategies for obesity management is summarized emphasizing some of the key components treatment effectiveness data and needed Az for further research overall it is concluded that BT is both the most studied and most ERP therapy for treating obesity at present gastroenterologists are encouraged to use it as a first L1 of treatment for most obese patients and as a key component of therapies that involve pharmacologic and surgical components
SR,stretch reflex,TS-3301,the aim of this T0 was to quantify upper motor neuron umn involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als by the soleus SR
PS,partial seizures,TS-3302,PS are not uncommon in children they are classified into two types simple partial without impairment of consciousness and complex partial with impaired consciousness for both types the hallmark is onset of the seizure from a portion of one cerebral hemisphere as indicated by focal spikes or sharp waves on eeg the symptoms of SPS may include focal motor or somatosensory phenomena special sensory phenomena autonomic PS or psychic symptoms and these PS may occur CT or they may progress into a complex partial seizure with alteration of consciousness the complex partial phase may include simply an arrest of ongoing activity with altered awareness and a blank empty stare or there may also be automatisms including movements which are gestural alimentary mimicking verbal or ambulatory automatisms are predominantly seen in complex PS arising from temporal Az but they also may be seen in seizures with extratemporal ON if the epileptic discharge spreads throughout both CBF hemispheres the child will have a secondarily GTC convulsion eeg should be performed in any child who is suspected of having partial seizures if there are focal spikes or sharp waves then there is strong supportive evidence for a diagnosis of partial seizures in the proper clinical setting it should be remembered however that a normal routine eeg cannot be used to rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy in patients who have episodes that sound like simple or CPSs an underlying etiology may be found in a significant percentage of children with partial seizures most of these etiologies are static and the seizures are the result of a previous cerebral insult but some patients may have slowgrowing gliomas or other mass lesions mri or ct is indicated in essentially any child with PS medical treatment is based on the idea of using single drugs to maximally tolerated doses if needed before beginning with twodrug regimens if the child continues to have seizures despite aggressive trials of medication then it is important to consider epilepsy surgery either TL or other cortical resection when children are identified as candidates for ES nt of the enzyme was found in the anterior pituitary the enzyme level about ngmg cytosol protein corresponded to about of the enzyme content in porcine IP WBCs posterior and intermediate lobes showed about onetenth of the enzyme level of anterior PIT other parts of porcine brain contained the lipoxygenase in amounts below ngmg cytosol protein the cytosol fraction mg of protein of anterior pituitary produced shydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid from microm arachidonic acid in about conversion at degrees c for min giving a TPS CEA about nmolminmg protein furthermore various octadecapolyenoic acids were oxygenated almost as fast as the arachidonate oxygenation when anterior pituitary was investigated IHC with antilipoxygenase antibody most of the immunostained cells were certain parenchymal cells with granules which were not blood cells these biochemical and immunohistochemical results provide a good reason for considering that lipoxygenase does play an important role in pituitary function
DA,diffuse adherence,TS-3303,previous studies have identified enteroadherent escherichia coli that exhibit localized adherence DA and atypical DA as diarrhoeagenic agents associated with infantile diarrhoea in calcutta india in this study a dna probe specific for enteroaggregative adherence was used to determine the etiological significance of enteroaggregative e coli in the causation of diarrhoea from a total of strains of e coli recovered from cases of acute secretory diarrhoea and cases of invasive diarrhoea strains hybridized with the probe whereas of the e coli strains recovered from healthy controls only strain hybridized with the probe of the probe positive strains adhered to hela cells in the typical stackedbrick DP while strains recovered from cases of sec diarrhoea adhered to the glass surface in a hitherto undescribed formation which we have termed based on the appearance as the honeycomb pattern the enteroaggregative e coli strains identified in this study did not produce any conventional enterotoxins and were significantly associated with patients with secretory diarrhoea than with invasive diarrhoea the results of this study indicate that enteroaggregative e coli play a causal role in acute secretory diarrhoea in this part of the world which lends credence to the involvement of a potent toxin in the pathogenesis age and education both groups were administered the mini mental state exam mmse and the behavioral dyscontrol scale bds a test based on lurias studies of FL dysfunction that measures the capacity for regulation of purposeful activity the ms patients performed more poorly than comparison subjects on the bds but not on the mmse the ms sample was then divided into two groups according to whether patients obtained low n or high scores n on the bds compared with highscoring patients lowscoring patients showed greater behavioral inertia and greater disruption of the ability to regulate purposeful activity in the performance of MICs of daily living behavioral disturbances in these individuals thus require careful assessment among those who show deficient capacity for behavioral control the most efficacious interventions may involve the use of cueing provision of structure supervision and environmental modifications
SPL,phage lysate,TS-3304,we report the cloning in escherichia coli of the gene encoding an extracellular endodextranase alphaglucanhydrolase ec from streptococcus salivarius pc recombinants from a s salivarius pclambda zap ii genomic library specifying Dex activity were identified as plaques surrounded by zones of clearing on blue dextran agar one such clone pd had a kb ecori fragment insert which encoded a kda protein with Dex activity the recombinant CS also produced two lowermolecularmass polypeptides and kda that had dextranase activity native Dex was recovered from concentrated culture fluids of s salivarius as a single kda polypeptide pd SPL and pc culture supernatant fluid extract were used to measure ATP specificity of the recombinant and native forms of dextranase respectively analysis of these MRP by TLC revealed the expected isomaltosaccharide products yielded by the recombinantspecified enzyme but was unable to resolve the larger polysaccharide products of the native enzyme furthermore s salivarius utilized neither the substrates nor the products of dextran hydrolysis for growth
MAC,microcystic adnexal carcinoma,TS-3305,maintaining the intricate bone mineral homeostasis in patients with chronic renal failure and renal osteodystrophy is a complex and challenging process in addition to the well described highturnover bone disease caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism and lowturnover disease in the form of osteomalacia either from aluminum or a dynamic bone disease osteopenia also is present in endstage renal disease patients in contrast to CA in the ability of bone to remodel osteopenia is a deficiency in BMC or volume the prevalence of fractures in dialysis patients regardless of histomorphometry appears to exceed that observed in elderly women this osteopenia that occurs in chronic renal failure patients secondary to multiple AF that include hypogonadism medications such as CSs immobilization and the typical osteopenia associated with aging all of these factors amplify the risk of fracture in dialysiree cases of microcystic adnexal carcinoma of the skin all three being on the face two on the lips and one on the left eyebrow clinically the neoplasms were slow growing indurated nodules or plaques two of the cases displayed benign features on initial biopsy and their malignant potential could not be established at that stage on subsequent review the three neoplasms showed all the characteristic features of MAC as described by goldstein et al and the university of virginia study all three patients were treated by surgery in the form of wide excision they behaved in a highly locally malignant manner with excisions being incomplete in two of the lesions in spite of taking an adequate SM around the clinically assessable margins the other recurred after three years in spite of a histologically proven complete excision two of the tumours showed infiltration into the underlying muscle with PNS wider excision in the next stage with frozen section control achieved good clearance and after a five year followup period all are symptom free none of these tumours showed any evidence of distant spread
MR,motherreared,TS-3306,early descriptions of floating limb behaviors in monkeys were associated with isolation rearing a practice that ended more than two decades ago the present authors named various forms of behaviors in which a leg is elevated for no apparent reason floating limb suite fls floating limb behaviors identified in laboratory monkeys at the washington national primate research center wanprc consist of two subcategories distinguished by whether monkeys seem to react to the elevated leg or ignore it given the past association of isolation rearing with both selfbiting sb and floating limb the investigators predicted that sb and fls would be associated in monkeys not reared in isolation the investigators tracked over a period of years the presence of fls and sb in macaques macaca nemestrina m fascicularis m mulatta and papio cynocephalus at wanprc sb and both subcategories of fls occurred in MR and surrogatepeernurseryreared monkeys we analyzed presence of fls the two subcategories of fls and sb in macaques monitored for up to years and macaques observed for min of structured data collection the papio sample size was insufficient for statistical analysis both sampling methodologies found fls and fls subcategories to be associated with sb nearly half the monkeys only engaging in seemingly harmless nonreactive forms of fls also performed the potentially injurious SMB of selfbiting the positive association between fls and sb suggests that monkeys exhibiting one of these behaviors are at a heightened risk for developing the other one impediment to studying floating limb behaviors is lack of consensus on definitions this study defined seven forms of apparently functionless elevated limb behaviors continued research on AF associated with floating limb behaviors across demographic groups and settings may provide insights into the etiology and treatment of selfbiting
CP,common peroneal,TS-3307,presynaptic inhibition psi has been shown to modulate several neuronal pathways of PET relevance by selectively gating the connections between sensory inputs and spinal motoneurons thereby regulating the contribution of the SR circuitry to the ongoing MA in this study we investigated whether a differential regulation of ia afferent inflow by psi may be associated with the performance of two types of plantarflexion sensoriomotor tasks the subjects in a seated position controlled either the force level exerted by the foot against a rigid restraint force task ft or the angular position of the ankle when sustaining inertial loads position task pt that required the same level of muscle activation observed in ft subjects were instructed to maintain their forceposition at target C2 set at of maximum isometric voluntary contraction for ft and Â° for pt while visual feedback of the corresponding forceposition signals were provided unconditioned hreflexes ie control reflexes and hreflexes conditioned by electrical pulses applied to the CP nerve with conditioningtotest intervals of ms and ms corresponding to d and d inhibitions respectively were evoked in a random fashion a significant main effect for the type of the motor task ft vs pt p Î·p indicated that pts were undertaken with lower levels of ia psi converging onto the soleus motoneuron pool additionally a significant interaction between the type of inhibition d vs d and the type of motor task ft vs pt p Î·p indicated that d inhibition was associated with a significant reduction in psi C2 from tf to tp p Î·p whereas no significant difference between the tasks was observed for d inhibition p Î·p these results suggest that d and d inhibitions of the soleus hreflex are differentially modulated during the performance of plantarflexion ft and pt the reduced level of ongoing psi during pt suggests that in comparison to ft there is a larger reliance on inputs from muscle spindles primary afferents when the neuromuscular system is required to maintain positioncontrolled plantarflexion contractions
PE,prolonged exposure,TS-3308,previous studies have shown that circulating angiotensin ii aii increases renal na reabsorption via elevated nah exchanger isoform nhe activity we hypothesized that PE to aii leads to an increased expression of renal nhe by a transcriptionally mediated mechanism to test this hypothesis we utilized the proximal tubulelike okp cell L1 to evaluate the effects of h treatment with aii on nhe activity and gene expression aii significantly stimulated nhemediated ssensitive nah exchange inhibition of transcription with actinomycin d abolished the stimulatory effect of aii on nhemediated ph recovery in acidloaded okp cells this PE to aii was also found to elevate endogenous nhe mrna by an effect also abolished by inhibition of gene transcription to evaluate the molecular mechanism by which aii regulates nhe expression the activity of nhe promoter driven reporter gene was analyzed in transient transfection assays in transfected okp cells rat nhe promoter activity was significantly stimulated by aii treatment and preliminary mapping indicated that the aii responsive elements is present between and bp upstream of the TIS in the nhe gene promoter we conclude that a transcriptional mechanism is at least partially responsible for the chronic effects of aii treatment on renal nhe activity
AC,arterial compliance,TS-3309,the extent to which the clinical effects of angiotensin receptor blockers arb are related to ambient renin system activity remains poorly defined therefore we measured blood pressure bp C1 c and small c AC systemic vascular resistance svr plasma renin activity pra and the h UNaV unav and aldosterone before and and h C2 of single doses of PL and and mg of the arb olmesartan medoximil to unmedicated NT in the basal state svr was inversely related to unav r p the greater the unav the more vasodilated the subject indices of AC both c r p and c r p were inversely related to the basal pra renin also predicted olmesartaninduced changes in c r p and c r p the greater the basal pra the less the AC and the more compliance improved T3 olmesartan both systolic p and diastolic p bp fell significantly on olmesartan compared with placebo manova with time and relations were observed between the basal pra and olmesartaninduced changes in pressure SBP r p diastolic bp r p the greater the initial pra the more olmesartan lowered bp furthermore the more pressure fell the more pra rose reciprocally r p finally aldosterone excretion fell sig on each dose of olmesartan compared with placebo we conclude that the inverse relation of unav and svr illustrates the reciprocal role of volume versus constrictor factors in maintaining normal bp and pra is a physiologic determinant of AC in normal individuals and of the response to the arb olmesartan measurement of pra may help to predict clinical arb responses in individual subjects
RI,respiratory insufficiency,TS-3310,nutrition assessment is important during chronic RI to evaluate the level of malnutrition or obesity and should include body composition measurements the appreciation of fatfree and fat reserves in patients with chronic RI can aid in designing an adapted nutritional support eg nutritional support in malnutrition and food restriction in obesity the purpose of the present study was to crossvalidate fatfree and fat mass obtained by various bioelectric impedance bia formulas with the fatfree and fat mass measured by DEXA dxa and determine the formulas that are best suited to predict the fatfree and fat mass for a group of patients with severe chronic RI seventyfive patients women and men with chronic obstructive and restrictive respiratory insufficiency aged y were included in this study body composition was calculated according to different bia formulas for women and for men and compared with dxa because of the R2 calculated as standard deviations of kg fatfree mass for women and kg for men for the best predictive formula the use of the various existing bia formulas was considered not clinically relevant therefore diseasespecific formulas for patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency should be developed to improve the prediction of fatfree and fat mass by bia in these patients

AP,apurinic,TS-3340,many anticancer drugs poison topoisomerase ii by enhancing its doublestranded dna cleavage activity to determine whether dna lesions act as endogenous topoisomerase ii poisons we characterized the effects of positionspecific AP CS on enzyme activity lesions located within the base overhang generated by enzymemediated dna scission stimulated cleavage approximately fold without altering the specificity of topoisomerase ii dna breaks were doublestranded in nature proteinlinked and readily reversible in contrast AP sites located immediately outside the cleavage overhang were inhibitory thus AP sites which are the most commonly formed lesion in dna are positionspecific topoisomerase ii poisons a model is proposed that encompasses the actions of endogenous and exogenous topoisomerase ii poisons and provides a preexisting pathway for the cellular actions of topoisomerase iitargeted anticancer drugs
BC,black carbon,TS-3341,observations indicate a precipitation decline over large parts of southern africa since the s concurrently atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols have increased due to anthropogenic activities here we show that local BC and organic carbon aerosol emissions from biomass burning MICs are a main cause of the observed decline in southern african dry season precipitation over the last century near the main biomass burning regions global and regional modelling indicates precipitation decreases of with large spatial variability increasing global co concentrations further contribute to precipitation reductions somewhat less in magnitude but covering a larger area whereas precipitation changes from increased co are driven by largescale circulation changes the increase in biomass burning aerosols causes local drying of the atmosphere this T0 illustrates that reducing local biomass burning aerosol emissions may be a useful way to mitigate reduced rainfall in the region
ESS,epworth sleepiness scale,TS-3342,sleep disruption is a common yet rarely addressed complaint among patients who have undergone total joint arthroplasty tja this T0 assessed sleep quality before and after primary tja a total of patients who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty tha or total knee arthroplasty tka prospectively completed questionnaires during the preoperative early postoperative and late postoperative periods the survey included the ESS current sleeping habits and patient perspectives of sleep SQ and duration in the early postoperative period Â± weeks patients reported significant increases in sleep disturbance as denoted by increased length of time to fall asleep p and mean nightly awakenings p compared with the preoperative baseline at late postoperative followup Â± weeks patients sleep quality subsequently improved above the preoperative baseline approximately of patients tried a new sleeping method postoperatively the most common being new pillow placement no significant differences in pre or postoperative sleeping trends were noted between tha and tka patients these findings suggest transient sleep disturbance is common in the early postoperative period with subsequent improvement by month followup T3 a primary tja given the growing importance of patient satisfaction in health care systems orthopedic surgeons must manage patients expectations while working with them to optimize sleep quality T3 tja a multimodal RPA with preoperative counseling early postoperative sleep modifications and possibly preemptive use of medications may improve transient sleep disturbance among tja patients orthopedics ee
LSA,lateral septal area,TS-3343,a recent T0 demonstrated both an extrinsic and an intrinsic calretinin cr innervation of the rat septal complex and that a population of the extrinsic calretinin fibers is aspartateglutamatecontaining the aim of this T0 was to determine which types glur glur or both of ampa receptorcontaining lateral septal area neurons are innervated by extrinsic and intrinsic cr neurons and whether the intrinsic cr cells are gabaergic CS and electronmicroscopic single IS for cr glur and glur as well as light and electronmicroscopicdouble immunostaining experiments for cr plus glur and cr plus glur were performed in the LSA furthermore the mirror colocalization technique was employed on consecutive vibratome sections of the septal complex to investigate whether the intrinsic septal cr SN are gabaergic the results are summarized as follows both glur and glurimmunoreactive neurons are innervated by crcontaining fibers the majority of these synapses observed mainly on the soma and to a lesser extent on proximal dendrites of ampa receptorcontaining SN represent asymmetric synaptic membrane specializations a minority of crcontaining axon terminals associated with both glur and glurimmunoreactive neurons form symmetric contacts predominantly on their soma and of the lateral septal area cr cells are gabaergic these observations indicate that both glur and glurcontaining LSA SN receive a dual intrinsic and extrinsic cr innervation the former intrinsic cr boutons are gabaergic while the latter form asymmetric synaptic contacts are excitatory and probably originate in the supramammillary area since previous work has demonstrated that a population of supramammilloseptal fibers contain aspartate andor glu

ARS,antireflux surgery,TS-3345,LF became the gold standard in the surgical therapy of gerd in comparison with open procedures laparoscopic antireflux surgery has a lower morbidity rate a better early and late postoperative outcome and is more costeffective antireflux surgery can be performed after a critical evalutation of the patient including gastroscopy biopsy hphmanometry and after a long lasting conservative medical treatment indications for antireflux surgery are given by a failed medical treatment an insufficient compliance complications of gerd ie stenosis barrettesophagus and atypical reflux symptoms like chronic cough hoarseness or thoracic pain with presence of a pathological phmonitoring laparoscopic degrees nissenfundoplication with crurorrhaphy is our standard procedure whereas the degrees toupet technique in our tailored approach is the technique of choice for esophageal motility disorders results of ARS published in literature are discussed and compared with our own ten years experience with cases of LF
ED,endogenous depression,TS-3346,clinical psychometric psychophysiological and PSA EM transport variables were studied in patients with ED unipolarbipolar during acute depressive episode and in remission all parameters studied showed paralleled and unidirectional changes when depression was compared with remission period during a depressive episode unipolar patients had greater intensity of depression than bipolar patients ouabaindependent sodium fluxes were significantly lower in female than in male patients during depression than in remission in male bipolar patients the indexes of active transport in erythrocytes showed significant correlations with clinical ratings and with results of psychophysiological tests the results point to a possible relationship between various levels of physiological SF-36 in endogenous depression this suggests a generalised BG defect of energydependent membrane transport pertaining to both erythrocytes and nerve cells which may be linked to disturbances of activational processes within the CNS system
PS,pyloric sphincter,TS-3347,the architecture of nitric oxide noproducing SN in the rat pylorus was studied in relation to the muscular structure the musculature of the rat pylorus was observed to be composed of two discrete muscle loops proximal and distal sphincters connective tissue septa containing neural elements divided the thick musculature of the distal sphincter into many bundles the myenteric nerve plexus of the stomach with a subpopulation of noproducing nerves was continuous with that of the duodenum nitrinergic nerve fibers which originated from the antral myenteric plexus ran through the connective tissue septa in the pyloric musculature and were densely distributed on the submucosal surface of the distal sphincter the innermost portion of the distal sphincter consisted of smooth muscle cells showing many cytoplasmic processes and abundant nitrinergic nerve terminals this particular architecture of the nitrinergic nerves in the sphincter would seem to account for the coordinate motor CF of the rat PS
IA,intraabdominal,TS-3348,in recent years PAD pad of intraabdominal abscesses has become an important tool with regard to the treatment of intraabdominal sepsis the aim of this T0 is to assess the value of pad in the treatment of postoperative retentions between and the postoperative course of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery was analyzed mortality morbidity and comparison of different locations of IA abscesses were assessed pad was considered successful when the patient improved clinically within hours a decrease in the size of the abscess formation was noted and CR REC without further surgical MI occurred out of operated patients were diagnosed as having an IAA formation and were treated by pad in patients the PA developed within the upper quadrants in patients the PA developed within the lower quadrants and in the remaining patients the PA developed within the RP cavity or pelvis the success rate of pad was with a morbidity rate of the least successful location for pad was the left upper quadrant patients with PA drainage in the right upper and lower quadrant experienced a high success rate one patient died due to the pad procedure unsuccessful pad was closely related muta from key largo florida and xestospongia testudinaria from manado indonesia this suggests that these CG are true symbionts in these sponges and may play a common role in both the pacific and atlantic sponge species the fourth group was found only in x testudinaria and was a novel assemblage distantly related to any previously sequenced actinobacterial clones the only actinobacteria that were obtained in initial culturing attempts were gordonia micrococcus and brachybacterium spp none of which were represented in the clone libraries the closest cultured actinobacteria to all the acidimicrobidae clones from xestospongia spp are microthrix parvicella and acidimicrobium spp xestospongia spp can now be targeted as source material from which to SC novel acidimicrobidae to investigate their potential as producers of bioactive compounds isolation of spongeassociated acidimicrobidae will also make it possible to elucidate their role as sponge symbionts
CS,central sulcus,TS-3349,a previous meg T0 on neural activities during the orientation singleton search showed that both efficient and inefficient searches shared a common neural network and the search efficiency was determined by a neural process executed in the temporal and parietal Az the target segmentation stage however remains to be elucidated in the present study meg and fmri experiments were conducted and momentmagnitudes of ECDs were estimated with an fmriconstrained meg multidipole method to obtain differences between targetpresent and absent conditions in each brain region for the whole time course the dipole moments around the calcarine sulcus cas and posterior FG pfug increased at latencies around ms activity around the cas consisted of a prominent and a subsequent smaller but still obvious peak ms the P1 showed no difference between conditions while the second peak was significantly larger in the targetpresent condition activity around the pfug had a prominent peak ms and subsequent small activity ms whereas the targets presence or not had no influence on either activity the activity of the right intraparietal sulcus ips was significantly larger than that for the left ips at latencies around ms irrespective of the targets presence or not the activity of the other BB regions such as the posterior superior temporal sulcus cingulate sulcus and CS showed no difference between target conditions the results demonstrate that neural MICs of multiple regions had different temporal characteristics and the later activity around the cas was related to the target segregation from its surroundings during the orientation contrast search
DMD,duchenne,TS-3350,DMD muscular dystrophy dmd is a severe degenerative disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene mdx muscles are characterised by progressive myofibre necrosis in which inflammation plays a deleterious role however the molecular mechanisms underlying inflammationinduced CN in muscle cells are unknown here we show that necroptosis is a mechanism underlying myofibre death in dystrophindeficient muscle ripk ripk and mlkl are upregulated in mdx myofibres in human dmd samples there is strong immunoreactivity to ripk and phosphomlkl in myofibres in vitro tnfÎ± can elicit necroptosis in cc myoblasts and ripk overexpression sensitises myoblasts to undergo tnfinduced death furthermore genetic ablation of ripk in mdx mice reduces myofibre degeneration inflammatory infiltrate and muscle fibrosis and eventually improves muscle CF these findings provide the first evidence of necroptotic cell death in a disease affecting skeletal muscle and identify ripk as a key player in the degenerative process in dystrophindeficient muscles
PD,parkinsonian,TS-3351,systemic inhibition of complex i by rotenone in rats represents a MM of parkinsons disease pd the aim of this T0 was to elucidate whether neramexane nmda nicotinic alphaalpha and ht receptor antagonist IDA alphaadrenoceptor antagonist or methylphenylethylpyrimidine mpep metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist prevents rotenoneinduced parkinsonianlike behaviours and neurochemical changes in rats rotenone mgkg ip daily was po over days together with saline neramexane mgkg ip bid IDA mgkg ip bid or mpep mgkg ip bid the same doses of neramexane IDA and mpep were po to rats treated with vehicle instead of rotenone treatmentrelated effects on parkinsonianlike behaviours such as hypokinesiarigidity and locomotor activity were evaluated moreover concentrations of dopamine serotonin and their metabolites were measured in rats from each experimental group over the day treatment period the rotenonesaline treated animals developed hypokinesia expressed as an increase in the bar and grid descent latencies in the catalepsy test and a decrease in locomotor activity neramexane and idazoxan partially prevented the OD of catalepsy in rotenonetreated rats coadministration of mpep with rotenone resulted only in a decrease in descent RL in the grid test on day chronic rotenone treatment reduced concentrations of dopamine and serotonin in the anterior striatum which was blocked by cotreatment with neramexane or idazoxan but not with mpep only neramexane treatment blocked the rotenoneinduced decrease in dopamine C2 in the substantia nigra pars compacta in conclusion neramexane and idazoxan counteracted to some extent the OD of PD PS and neurochemical alterations in the rotenone model of FPD
MA,methyl acrylate,TS-3352,starch graft polymethyl acrylate sgpma was prepared by ceric ion initiation of MA in an aqueous CS slurry prime starch which maximized the accessibility of the ST for graft polymerization a new ceric ion reaction CS was established as starchinitiatormethyl acrylate followed by addition of a small amount of ceric ion solution when the VG polymerization was almost CR to quench the reaction as a result of this improved procedure no unreacted MA monomer remained and thus essentially no ungrafted polymethyl acrylate homopolymer was formed in the final grafted product quantities of the high purity sgpma so prepared in pilot scale were converted to resin pellets and loosefill foam by single screw and twin screw extrusion the use of prime starch significantly improved the physical properties of the final loosefill foam in comparison to foam produced from regular dry corn ST the sgpma loosefill foam had compressirface equivalent to those of the two hbc L1 epitopes moreover we identified another antigenic region ar aa ii that was recognized by all sera from chronically INF dna or proteinimmunized ducks within the large aa insertion in dhbc protein suggesting that this region which lacks hbc is externally exposed
MD,monocularly deprived,TS-3353,experiencedependent STDP in the developing visual SC depends on electrical activity and molecular signals involved in stabilization or removal of inputs ERK kinase also called p MAP kinase activation in the cortex is regulated by both factors we show that two different inhibitors of the erk pathway suppress the induction of two forms of longterm potentiation ltp in rat cortical slices and that their intracortical administration to MD rats prevents the shift in OD towards the nondeprived eye these results demonstrate that the erk pathway is necessary for experiencedependent STDP and for ltp of ifying genes contributing to the risk of OP HF in the general population
CM,ciliary muscle,TS-3354,calponins are a family of actinbinding proteins known to regulate aortic and tracheal smooth muscle contraction this investigation was undertaken to assess the presence subtype and distribution of calponin proteins in human CM iris and other anterior segment tissues as well as expression in CM cells in vitro
SR,sinus rhythm,TS-3355,patients with atrial fibrillation compared with those with SR are at increased risk for TE often mandating therapy directed at thromboembolism prevention however the safest most efficacious strategy to prevent thromboembolism associated with atrial fibrillation is unknown we developed a decision analysis to compare the risks and benefits of two common clinical strategies to prevent TE in the patient with atrial fibrillation SR maintenance with QS or with amiodarone hydrochloride T3 cardioversion and LT AC with warfarin sodium
CT,cytoplasmic tail,TS-3356,in myeloid dendritic cells mdcs tlr is expressed in the endosomal membrane and interacts with the adaptor tollinterleukin receptor homology domaincontaining adaptor molecule ticam trif ticam signals culminate in interferon ifn regulatory factor irf activation coculture of mdc pretreated with the tlr ligand polyic and A-NK nk cells resulted in nk cell activation this activation was triggered by celltocell contact but not cytokines using expression profiling and gainlossoffunction analyses of mdc genes we tried to identify a ticaminducing membrane protein that participates in mdcmediated nk activation of the nine candidates screened one contained a tetraspaninlike sequence and satisfied the screening criteria the protein referred to as irfdependent nkactivating molecule inam functioned in both the mdc and nk cell to facilitate nk activation in the mdc ticam ifn promoter stimulator and irf but not irf were required for mdcmediated nk activation inam was minimally expressed on nk cells was upregulated in response to polyic and contributed to mdcnk reciprocal activation via its CT which was crucial for the activation signal in nk cells adoptive transfer of inamexpressing mdcs into mice implanted with nksensitive PT caused nkmediated tumor regression we identify a new pathway for mdcnk contactmediated nk activation that is governed by a tlr signalderived membrane molecule
SS,subsarcolemmal,TS-3357,binge drinking is associated with increased risk for cerebrovascular spasm and stroke acute exposure to ethanol at concentrations obtained during binge drinking constricts CBF arteries in several species including humans but the mechanisms underlying this action are largely unknown in a rodent model we used fluorescence microscopy patchclamp electrophysiology and pharmacological studies in IN cerebral arteries to pinpoint the molecular effectors of ethanol cerebrovascular constriction clinically relevant concentrations of ethanol elevated wall intracellular ca concentration and caused a reversible constriction of CBF arteries ec mm emax mm that depended on Kv ca entry into myocytes however ethanol did not directly increase voltagedependent ca currents in isolated myocytes constriction occurred because of an ethanol reduction in the frequency and amplitude of transient caactivated k bk currents ethanol inhibition of bk transients was caused by a reduction in ca spark frequency a SS ca signal that evokes the bk transients and a direct inhibition of bk channel steadystate activity in contrast ethanol failed to modify ca waves a major vasoconstrictor mechanism selective block of bk channels largely prevented ethanol constriction in pressurized arteries this T0 pinpoints the ca sparkbk channel negativefeedback mechanism as the primary effector of ethanol vasoconstriction

NC,normal children,TS-3359,the total protein Al globulin and immunoglobulin C2 of sera from children with homozygous sickle cell disease were studied a comparison of the results with the C2 found in a control group of NC of the same age shows that the sicklers have higher total protein globulin and igm levels the amounts of Al and iga seen were almost the same in both CG the igg C2 differed considerably the sicklers having only about half the quantity seen in NC
TA,transient absorption,TS-3360,absorbent layers of semiconductor quantum dots qds are now used as material platforms for lowcost highperformance solar cells the semiconductor metal oxide NPs as an acceptor SL have become an integral part of the next generation solar cell to achieve sufficient electron transfer and subsequently high conversion efficiency in these solar cells however energylevel alignment and interfacial contact between the donor and the acceptor units are needed here the layerbylayer lbl technique is used to assemble zno NPs nps providing adequate pbs qd uptake to achieve greater interfacial contact compared with traditional sputtering methods electron i.t. at the pbs qd and zno np interface is investigated using broadband TA spectroscopy with femtosecond temporal resolution the results indicate that electron injection from photoexcited pbs qds to zno nps occurs on a time scale of a few hundred femtoseconds this observation is supported by the interfacial electronicenergy alignment between the donor and acceptor moieties finally due to the combination of large interfacial contact and ultrafast electron injection this proposed platform of assembled thin films holds promise for a variety of solar cell architectures and other settings that principally rely on interfacial contact such as photocatalysis
FG,fasting glucose,TS-3361,tissue sensitive to insulin and insulin IB to monocytes were evaluated in nonobese maturityonset diabetics and in HCs insulin sensitivity was determined by the insulin clamp technique in which the PI is acutely raised and maintained muuml above the fasting level and PG is held constant at fasting levels by a variable gl infusion the amount of glucose infused is a measure of overall tissue sensitivity to insulin in the DM the FPG concentration mgdl was greater than controls p whereas the PI level muuml was similar to controls during the insulin clamp study comparable plasma insulin levels were achieved in the diabetics and the controls muuml however the gl infusion rate in the diabetics mgkgmin was below controls p among the diabetics the gl infusion rate correlated directly with the fasting PG level r p in five diabetic subjects glucose metabolism was similar to controls and these diabetics had the highest FG C2 when they were restudied T3 prior normalization with insulin of the FPG mgdl the gl infusion rate during the insulin clamp was lower than observed in association with hyperglycemia p studies that employed 3H gl to measure endogenous glucose production indicated comparable inhibition of HGP during hyperinsulinemia in the diabetic and control subjectsiinsulin IB to monocytes in the diabetics was below that in controls p insulin IB to monocytes and insulin action as determined with the insulin clamp were highly correlated in both control r p and diabetic subjects r p we conclude that a tissue sensitivity to physiologic hyperinsulinemia is reduced in most maturityonset diabetics b this decrease in sensitivity is located at least in part in extrahepatic tissues c the resistance to insulin may be mediated by a reduction in insulin binding and d in maturityonset diabetics with T/N sensitivity to insulin HG may be a contributing factor to the normal rates of insulinmediated gl uptake
FR,food restriction,TS-3362,the effect of fasting h versus food restriction for days on the igfigf binding protein bp axis in female guinea pigs was studied and related to body weight weight gain and FCE circulating igfi was reduced in the fasted and foodrestricted animals igfii was only decreased in the foodrestricted group there was no effect of fasting on igfbp to while igfbp and were reduced by and respectively and igfbp increased by in the foodrestricted group FR reduced the relative sizes of fat depots SP liver thymus and heart increased those of adrenals kidneys pancreas gastrointestinal tract m biceps m soleus and brain while those of uterus lungs thyroids and m gastrocnemius were unchanged igfbp and were negatively correlated to WG and food conversion efficiency in the ad libitumfed group while igfi ii igfbp and were positively correlated to body weight weight gain and FCE in the foodrestricted group the results show that acute and chronic food restriction have different consequences for the igfigfbp axis furthermore igfii as well as igfi are implicated in the control of body weight weight gain and food conversion efficiency under conditions of restricted nutrition finally igfbp and may have different roles during chronic undernutrition compared with unrestrained nutrition in adult life
BC,body composition,TS-3363,the effect of supplements on NI digestibility n PR adg and blood and BC of growing lambs fed cut herbage or grazing ky tall fescue festuca arundinacea schreb pastures at two levels of n fertilization and kgha was determined supplements were corn c corn with soybean meal usbm and corn with heattreated sbm hsbm metabolism trials were run at three growth stages in the st yr with lambs although all supplements increased total dmi and dm digestibility they decreased ndf digestibility relative to grass g with no difference between supplements c depressed apparent cp digestibility nitrogen retention increased from gd on g to gd on c and and gd on usbm and hsbm respectively for combined periods and n rates blood urea n bun concentrations differed p less than in the following order g greater than usbm greater than hsbm greater than c in the nd yr lambs n grazed fescue pastures at the same n fertilizer rates and were given the same supplements gains were not different p less than on lown ln and highn hn pastures seasonal adg were and gd for g c usbm and hsbm treatments respectively with no difference p less than between usbm and hsbm at slaughter lambs from g had lower dressing percentages p less than and fat content p less than than lambs on c usbm and hsbm treatments with no differences between supplements results indicated a better performance of growing lambs on fescue with both SE and protein supplements response to protected vs unprotected protein was small
LF,liver function,TS-3364,chronic propranolol administration is followed by some haemodynamic alterations which may impair renal CF it has also been suggested that it may reduce PLT production of proaggregatory thromboxane tx a we therefore evaluated cardiac index ci SVR V1 resistance svr creatinine clearance daily sodium excretion under controlled sodium intake PLT aggregation and PLT txa production during whole blood clotting in eight patients with cirrhosis portal hypertension and no ascites before and T3 months of propranolol administration LF was also assessed by evaluating the Gal EC gec and galactose clearance cgal the expected significant reduction of ci and increase of svr was observed creatinine clearance and sodium balance were unchanged throughout the study furthermore the renal prostaglandin system as reflected by urinary prostaglandin e and txb excretion was also unaffected by the drug no modification of platelet aggregation platelet txa production during whole blood clotting gec and cgal was observed we conclude that chronic propranolol administration is followed by alterations of ci and svr but it does not impair renal CF and PLT aggregation in patients with cirrhosis portal hypertension and no ascites the maintenance of renal CF during betaadrenergic blockade is not due to an increased renal production of vasodilating prostaglandins
MIS,melanoma in situ,TS-3365,the incidence of melanoma has steadily increased over the past three decades MIS mis defined as melanoma that is limited to the epidermis contributes to a disproportionately high percentage of this rising incidence amelanotic melanoma presents as an erythematous macule or plaque and may initially be misdiagnosed as an inflammatory disorder we report a case of amelonatic mis raised on nonsunexposed skin inducing a lichen planuslike keratosis as inflammatory reaction which clinically masked the melanoma
DE,digestible energy,TS-3366,saturated and unsaturated fatty acid supplements fs were evaluated for effects on yield of milk and milk components concentration of milk components including milk HFA profile and EB eight ruminally and duodenally cannulated cows and noncannulated cows were used in a replicated x latin square design experiment with d periods treatments were control and a linear substitution of fatty acids from saturated fs sat prilled hydrogenated free fatty acids for partially unsaturated fs uns calcium soaps of longchain fatty acids the sat treatment did not change milk fat concentration but uns linearly decreased MF in cannulated cows and tended to decrease milk fat in noncannulated cows compared with control MF depression with uns corresponded to increased concentrations of trans cis conjugated LA and trans c fatty acids in milk MF profile was similar for sat and control but uns decreased concentration of short and mediumchain fa DE intake tended to decrease linearly with increasing unsaturated fs in cannulated and noncannulated cows increasing unsaturated fs linearly increased empty body weight and net energy gain in cannulated cows whereas increasing saturated fs linearly increased plasma insulin efficiency of conversion of DE to milk tended to decrease linearly with increasing unsaturated fs for cannulated cows only addition of sat provided little benefit to production and EB whereas uns decreased SE NI and milk energy yield
ST,stanozolol,TS-3367,significant use of embryo transfer in dairy cattle commenced with the introduction of nonsurgical embryo recovery in the mids and developed with the use of nonsurgical transfers in the late s numbers of registered holstein calves from embryo transfer doubled yearly through after which the rate of increase slowed the total reached nearly calves in however the tau of superovulation procedures and commercial success rates of transferred fresh embryos have not improved the past to yr fertilization rates in superovulated donors remain low although embryosplitting techniques were perfected in the early s directly injurious to the CVS the direct myocardial cellular consequences of abuse of these drugs are not known therefore the purpose of this T0 was to describe the concentration and timedependent effects of testosterone cypionate tc ST s and fluoxymesterone f on primary myocardial cell cultures DUE of drug effects were made in dold primary myocardial cell cultures obtained from to dold spraguedawley rats the cultures were exposed to x m x m and x m concentrations of tc s and f each for and h cellular injury was evaluated by alterations in beating activity induction of morphological alterations lactate dehydrogenase ldh release neutral red retention and tetrazolium mtt formazan production significant alterations in beating activity were observed in the x m tc group in which no beating activity was seen at and h morphological integrity was disrupted for the x m tc group at h where destruction of the ML was observed unlike the cultures treated with the three concentrations of both s and f significant ldh release was seen at and h with those cultures exposed to x m tc in the evaluation of NR retention x m tc at h showed a significant decrease in ability to retain the dyeabstract truncated at words
SM,submandibular,TS-3368,the secretion pressure as well as the resistance of glandula submandibularis towards retrograde instillation of water are determined electromanometrically the results are compared with such measurements carried out by the same method in the PG the pressure behaviour of the SM gland corresponds with some quantitative differences to the behaviour of the PG the differences show the generally lower secretion SP of SM gland however there are no differences in the resistance against a retrograde instillation of water between SM and parotid gland the connections of the observed and calculated parameters and clinical patterns are discussed
HDT,highdose therapy,TS-3369,a significant proportion of patients with lymphoid malignancies are hardtomobilize with a combination of chemotherapy plus granulocyte colonystimulating factor gcsf chemomobilization plerixafor is a novel drug used to improve mobilization of blood stem cells however it has been studied mainly in association with gcsf mobilization we evaluated the efficacy of preemptive use of plerixafor T3 chemomobilization in patients who seem to mobilize poorly during a month period altogether patients with lymphoid malignancies were admitted to our department for blood stem cell collection sixteen patients received plerixafor after the first mobilization due to the low blood b cd cell counts n or poor yield of the first collection n the median number of plerixafor injections was the median bcd count after the first plerixafor dose was Ã\x97 l with the median increase of fivefold stem cell aphaereses were performed in patients receiving plerixafor and a median of Ã\x97 kg cd cells were collected with a median of one aphaeresis altogether patients mobilized with a combination of chemomobilization and plerixafor received HDT with SC support and all engrafted preemptive use of plerixafor after chemomobilization is efficient and safe and should be considered in poor mobilizers to avoid collection failure in patients with low but rising bcd counts the use of plerixafor might be delayed as late mobilization may occur further studies are needed to optimize patient selection and timing of plerixafor

CT,corticothalamic,TS-3371,following injection of the tritiumlabeled proteinacylating agent nsuccinimidyl propionate into the neostriatum in rats retrograde labeling of NS cells in the pars compacta of the subtantia nigra and anterograde labeling of the striatonigral terminal field in the nigral pars reticulata were demonstrated by ARG at hr survival labeling of the corticopontine terminal field and of CT cell bodies in cortical layer were also seen deriving from corticofugal fibers of passage through the striatal injection site in comparison neostriatal i.t. of horseradish peroxidase was found to yield nigral cell and terminal field labeling but the corticopontine terminal field was not labeled and very few cortical cells in layer were labeled these results show that the VA and anterograde axonal transport of endogenous proteins can be profitably studied by this in vivo proteinacylating technique and suggest that the method may prove useful as a connectiontracing technique especially because of the novel attribute of labeling terminal fields by anterograde axonal transport following i.v. into VWM axonal bundles with concomitant labeling od the cell HB of origin of these axons

MAP,mean arterial bp,TS-3373,anorexia and malnutrition confer significant morbidity and mortality to patients with endstage kidney disease but are resistant to therapy the aim of this T0 was to determine whether subcutaneous administration of ghrelin an appetitestimulating gut hormone could enhance food NI in patients who are receiving maintenance PD and have evidence of malnutrition the principal outcome measure was energy NI during a measured T0 meal AA outcome measures were bp and heart rate and d food NI T3 intervention nine peritoneal dialysis patients with mild to moderate malnutrition mean serum Al gl total cholesterol mmoll SGA score of were given subcutaneous ghrelin nmolkg and saline PL in a randomized doubleblind crossover protocol administration of subcutaneous ghrelin significantly increased the group mean absolute energy intake compared with placebo during the study meal versus kcal p when expressed as proportional SE increase for each individual ghrelin administration resulted in immediate doubling of SE intake versus p administration of ghrelin maintained a NS increase in SE intake over h after intervention versus kcal and was not followed by subsequent underswing versus and versus kcal on days and respectively ghrelin administration resulted in a significant fall in MAP p by anova there were no significant adverse events during the study subcutaneous ghrelin administration enhances shortterm FI in dialysis patients with mf acidmethanoldenatured ubiquitin it is demonstrated that the esi chargestate CSD csd and the extent of hdx represent nonredundant probes of the protein structure in solution when considered in isolation the data provided by both of these probes are consistent with a twostate SMB involving only denatured ubiquitin d and refolded protein f however a careful comparison of the csd and hdx kinetics reveals the presence of an additional species exhibiting a csd like the folded protein but showing nonnative hdx characteristics this kinetic intermediate d is in rapid equilibrium with d such that the overall reaction is consistent with the mechanism d d f the results of this work suggest that the occurrence of transient intermediates may be more widespread than commonly thought especially in cases where a cursory analysis indicates twostate behavior
ET,escherichia coli endotoxin,TS-3374,endotoxin causes acute lung injury resembling acute respiratory distress syndrome PE as well as reactive oxygen species released from G1 neutrophils are thought to play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of this lung injury this T0 investigated whether ono a specific elastase inhibitor can attenuate ALI induced by endotoxin in rabbits thirtytwo male anesthetized rabbits were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments n for each group infusion of saline without ono treatment group ss infusion of saline with ono group so infusion of ET microgramskg over min without ono group es and infusion of endotoxin with ono group eo fifteen minutes before the infusion of endotoxin groups eo and es or saline CG ss and so the animals received a bolus injection of ono mgkg followed by continuous infusion mgkgh groups so and eo or saline CG ss and es the lungs of the rabbits were ventilated with oxygen hemodynamics peripheral leukocyte and PLT counts and pao were recorded during the ventilation period h lung mechanics cell fraction of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf activated complement cytokines and AA metabolite concentrations in the balf were measured at h the wet to dry wdweight ratio of the lung and Al concentrations in balf were analyzed as indices of pulmonary edema endotoxin decreased lung compliance and pao and increased the wd weight ratio neutrophil counts and ALB in the balf concentrations of activated complement ca interleukin interleukin and thromboxane b in the balf were increased by the infusion of endotoxin ono treatment attenuated these changes endotoxin caused extensive morphologic lung damage which was lessened by ono in conclusion intravenous ono i.c.v. att endotoxininduced lung injury in rabbits this beneficial effect of ono may be due in part to a reduction in the levels of mediators that activate neutrophils in addition to the direct GABA effect on PE
SF,soluble fibrin,TS-3375,comprehensive studies of fibrinolysis in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma have been limited and assignment of patients to highlow prognosis groups based on arbitrary cutoffs utilizing fibrinolytic measurements is unstandardized this study was performed in patients to examine the effects of cutoff values determined in three ways model assigned patients to one of three equal CG low medium high based on fibrinolytic measurements made at diagnosis MM divided patients into lowhigh CG using median values and model grouped according to the parameter being abovebelow normal range in model raised plasma fibrinogen ddimer and soluble fibrin were positively associated with poorer survival in model tissue plasminogen activator antigen was additionally related to poorer prognosis MM identified seven parameters as significantly related to survival two not identified by the other models becoming significant PAP tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor pai antigen using MVA PF level was the most uniformly significant parameter relative risk estimates indicated that raised PF SF and ddimer were associated with increased risk of death use of the normalabove normal cutoff is recommended to provide the maximum number of significant parameters relating to prognosis and increased plasma ddimer pai antigen and fibrinogen were most closely related to survivalprognosis
SM,memory,TS-3376,t lymphocytes play a central role in the generation of a protective immune response in many microbial infections T3 immunization dendritic cells take up microbial antigens and traffic to draining CL NO where they present processed antigens to naÃ¯ve TA these naÃ¯ve TA are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate into effector and SM t cells activated effector and memory TA provide b cell help in the lymph NO and traffic to sites of infection where they secrete antimicrobial cytokines and kill INF cells at least two types of SM cells have been defined in humans based on their PET and migratory properties t centralmemory tcm cells are found predominantly in lymphoid organs and can not be immediately activated whereas t effectormemory tem cells are found predominantly in peripheral tissue and sites of inflammation and exhibit rapid effector function most currently licensed vaccines induce antibody responses capable of mediating longterm protection against lytic viruses such as influenza and small pox in contrast vaccines against chronic pathogens that require CMI responses to control such as malaria mycobacterium tuberculosis tb HIV virus hiv and HC virus hcv are currently not available or are ineffective understanding the mechanisms by which longlived cellular immune responses are generated following vaccination should facilitate the OD of safe and ERP vaccines against these emerging diseases here we review the current literature with respect to memory t cells and their implications to vaccine development
EM,electron microscope,TS-3377,the wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in developmental processes including embryonic patterning cell specification and cell polarity wnt components participate in the development of the CNS system and growing evidence indicates that this pathway also regulates the function of the adult nervous system in this study we report that wnta a noncanonical wnt ligand is a potent activator of mitochondrial dynamics and induces acute fission and F0 events in the mitochondria of rat hippocampal neurons the effect of wnta was inhibited in the presence of sfrp a wnt scavenger similarly the canonical wnta ligand had no effect on mitochondrial fissionfusion events suggesting that this effect is TPS for wnta CT we also show that the wnta effects on mitochondrial dynamics occur with an increase in both intracellular and mitochondrial calcium ca which was correlated with an increased phosphorylation of drpser and a decrease of ser phosphorylation both indicators of mitochondrial dynamics EM analysis of HPC tissues in the ca region showed an increase in the number of mitochondria present in the postsynaptic region and this finding correlated with a change in mitochondrial morphology we conclude that wntaca signaling regulates the mitochondrial fissionfusion process in HPC SN a feature that might help to further understand the role of wntrelated pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and represents a potentially important link between impaired metabolic CF and degenerative disorders
NC,nephrocalcinosis,TS-3378,the tight junction proteins claudin and are crucial for the paracellular reabsorption of cations along the thick ascending limb of henles loop in the kidney in patients mutations in cldn cause familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and NC while mutations in cldn impair kidney CF mice lacking claudin display magnesium and calcium wasting whereas absence of claudin results in hypermagnesemia and interstitial nephrocalcinosis in order to study the functional interdependence of claudin and we generated doubledeficient mice these mice had NS magnesium and urinary excretion of magnesium and calcium and showed polyuria and sodium retention at the expense of increased renal potassium excretion but no nephrocalcinosis isolated thick ascending limb tubules of double mutants displayed a complete loss of paracellular cation selectivity and functionality mice lacking both claudin and in the thick ascending limb recruited downstream compensatory mechanisms and showed HCM distal convoluted tubules with changes in mRNA and phosphorylation of ion transporters in this segment presumably triggered by the mild decrease in serum potassium thus severe individual phenotypes in claudin and claudin KO are corrected by the additional deletion of the other claudin
DF,dermatofibroma,TS-3379,nineteen cases of DF associated with monster cells are reported the term monster an animal with a strange or terrifying shape one unusually C1 for its kind implies a strikingly atypical cell with an extremely large nucleus except for monster cells these lesions had all of the typical histopathological findings of DF the clinical diagnosis for of these lesions was dermatofibroma or histiocytoma three lesions were submitted without any clinical diagnosis eighteen of lesions occurred on the extremities one was on the back monster cells are seen in the early histiocytic stage of DF when lipophages andor siderophages are usually present in large numbers only rarely were MF seen in dermatofibromas with monster cells and they were neither numerous nor atypical it is important for histopathologists to distinguish DF with monster cells from cutaneous malignant FH and radiation sarcoma the criteria for differentiation concern primarily the architectural DP of the lesion rather than its cytological features
NR,nitroreductase,TS-3380,a NR enzyme has been isolated from escherichia coli that has the unusual property of being equally capable of using either nadh or nadph as a cofactor for the reduction of its substrates which include menadione as well as aziridinyldinitrobenzamide cb this property is shared with the rat enzyme dt diaphorase the NR can like dt diaphorase also use simple reduced pyridinium compounds as virtual cofactors the IN nadph molecule is not required and the simplest quaternary and therefore reducible derivative of nicotinamide methylnicotinamide reduced is as effective as nadph in its ability to act as an electron donor for the nitroreductase the structureactivity relationship is not identical to that of dt diaphorase and nicotinic acid riboside reduced is selective being active only for the nitroreductase irrespective of the virtual cofactor used the nitroreductase formed the same reduction products of cb the and hydroxylamino derivatives in equal proportions nicotinic acid riboside reduced unlike nadh was SD to metabolism by serum enzymes and had a plasma halflife of seven T2 in the mouse after an iv bolus administration nadh had an unmeasurably short halflife NIC riboside reduced could also be produced in vivo by administration of NIC obenzoyl riboside reduced these results demonstrate that the requirement for a cofactor need not be a limitation in the use of reductive enzymes in antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy adept it is proposed that the e coli NR would be a suitable enzyme for adept in combination with B6 and a synthetic enzymeselective virtual cofactor such as nicotinic acid riboside reduced
HC,hepatitis c,TS-3381,about million people worldwide are chronically INF with HC virus hcv the persistence of the infection is controlled by several mechanisms including the induction of oxidative stress hcv relies on this strategy to redirect lipid metabolism machinery and escape immune response the Î²hydroxysterol Î´reductase dhcr is one of the newly discovered host markers of oxidative stress this protein as hcvinduced oxidative AS responsive protein may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of hcv chronic infection and associated CL diseases when aberrantly expressed the sustained expression of dhcr in response to hcvinduced oxidative AS results in suppression of nuclear p activity by blocking its acetylation and increasing its interaction with mdm in the cytoplasm leading to its degradation which may induce hepatocarcinogenesis
AE,alveolar echinococcosis,TS-3382,a year old male patient with a past medical history of a complete surgical excision of pelvic hydatid cyst two years previously presented with constant pelvic floor pain and plasma igg antiechinococcal antibody titres of uml based on that and the imaging findings of abdominal ultrasound us computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance mr the diagnosis of a recurrent retrorectal pelvic hydatid cyst was made three courses of oral albendazole treatment were po and sixteen weeks later the patient was admitted for a planned elective operation at that time a new ct scan revealed disappearance of the cyst while the serological tests showed a decrease in the igg antiechinococcal antibody titres to uml four different species of the echinococcus tapeworm can produce infection in humans e granulosus and e multilocularis are the most common causing cystic and AE respectively while e vogeli and e oligarthrus have only rarely been associated with human infection although surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for hydatid disease the present case could suggest that especially in cases of recurrent IA extrahepatic hydatid cyst treatment with albendazole may lead to disappearance of the recurrent cyst therefore should constitute a first line therapeutic option prior to any planned reoperation
PL,peroneus longus,TS-3383,to determine the effect of plasma growth hormone gh on skeletal muscle function we measured the free ca concentrationtension relationship of slowtwitch soleus and fasttwitch PL muscles isolated from rats undergoing acromegaly in response to implanted ghsecreting tumors muscles from adult mo and aged rats mo were studied T3 the tumorbearing rats weighted over more than their agematched controls caactivated P0 was recorded from skinned muscle SF for soleus muscles the free ca concentration producing of maximal tension ca was microm for rats with PT and microm for controls for PL fibers ca shifted from microm in controls to microm T3 tumors were introduced into either adult or aged rats SOL fibers from neonatal rats days were less sensitive to ca than those isolated from AD rats having a ca of microm the ca sensitivity of peroneus longus fibers did not change with age we conclude that significant increases in myofibrillar ca sensitivity occur in skeletal muscles undergoing rapid growth induced by ghsecreting tumors
NR,neural retina,TS-3384,the localization isoform DP and mrna CSD of the synapseorganizing molecule agrin was investigated in the developing avian retina i.t. of antiagrin fab fragments into the VH of chick eyes of embryonic days to a procedure that labels only extracellular agrin reveals IF in the inner and outer plexiform layers before during and T3 the period of synapse formation the labeling in these layers changes from a diffuse to a punctate pattern at the time when synapses form at all stages investigated the ILM a basal lamina that separates vitreous from NR is intensely labeled as are the axonal processes of retinal GCs in the optic fiber layer and in the optic nerve although the staining intensity declines T3 embryonic day in both retina and optic nerve in culture axons of retinal GCs also express agrinlike immunoreactivity on their surfaces PCR reaction analysis reveals that several different agrin isoforms are expressed in the developing neural retina in situ hybridization studies show that agrin isoforms are expressed in the ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers correlating well with the IF for agrin protein in the optic fiber and plexiform layers the expression of mrna coding for several agrin isoforms and the presence of extracellular agrin in the synapsecontaining layers during the period of synapse formation is consistent with the idea that agrin isoforms might play a role during synapse formation in the CNS system
BA,basilar,TS-3385,an intense lowfrequency tone about hz modulates the sensitivity of the inner ear to highfrequency stimulation this modulation is correlated with the MSD of the basilar membrane the findings suggest that the modulation may also affect cochlear tuning we have investigated modulation of cochlear tuning by lowfrequency sound in the guinea pig applying indirect methods of measurement narrowband analysis of compound action potentials and compoundactionpotential tuning curves the results suggest a shift of the excitation pattern along the BA membrane towards higherfrequency areas the shift occurred for both ST and scala vestibuli MSD of the cochlear partition TCs obtained from single units in the CN show sensitivity loss and a tip shift towards lower frequencies this was also found for both ST displacement and scala vestibuli MSD the shift of the tip of the PTC towards lower frequencies corresponds to the inferred highfrequency shift of the excitation DP the relationship of these phenomena with the pathophysiology of mÃ©niÃ¨res disease and with possible active mechanisms in cochlear transduction is discussed
SR,sinus rhythm,TS-3386,the purpose of this T0 was to investigate the timedependent effect of statin treatment and echocardiographic Epi FT eft on the maintenance of SR sr in atrial fibrillation af patients T3 electrical cardioversion ec one hundred sixtythree af patients without previous statin treatment who underwent ec were consecutively enrolled the maintenance rate of sr after ec and months as documented by electrocardiogram and eft were compared between patients with statin treatment statin group n and those without no statin group n there was no significant difference in the maintenance rate of sr between the groups soon after ec statin group vs no statin p after month vs p and after months vs p however the maintenance rate of sr was significantly higher in the statin group compared to no statin group vs p after months and this significant difference persisted up to months of follow up vs p patients with recurrence showed higher baseline eft Â± vs Â± mm p multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that eft LAD highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol statin treatment and dose were the significant contributors to the maintenance of sr for all periods T3 ec statin treatment and low eft were associated with a higher maintenance rate of sr in af patients T3 ec significant benefit of statin was realized months T3 ec and this benefit was shown to be maintained over time
LS,lowspin,TS-3387,the present T0 focuses on the formation and reactivity of hydroperoxoironiii porphyrin complexes formed in the feiiitpfppxhohoo system tpfpptetrakispentafluorophenylhhporphyrin xcl or cf so in acetonitrile under basic conditions at Â°c depending on the selected reaction conditions and the active form of the catalyst the formation of highspin feiiitpfppooh and lowspin feiiitpfppohooh could be observed with the application of a lowtemperature rapidscan uvvis spectroscopic technique axial ligation and the spin state of the ironiii center control the mode of oo bond cleavage in the corresponding hydroperoxo porphyrin species a mechanistic changeover from homo to heterolytic oo bond cleavage is observed for high feiiitpfppooh and LS feiiitpfppohooh complexes respectively in contrast to other ironiii hydroperoxo complexes with electronrich porphyrin ligands electrondeficient feiiitpfppohooh was stable under relatively mild conditions and could therefore be investigated directly in the oxygenation reactions of selected organic substrates the very low CR of feiiitpfppohooh towards organic substrates implied that the ferric hydroperoxo intermediate must be a very sluggish oxidant compared with the ironivoxo porphyrin Ï\x80cation radical intermediate in the catalytic oxygenation reactions of cytochrome p
FR,flexor reflex,TS-3388,the CE action particularly potential antidepressant activity of web a new nootropic drug related to piracetam was investigated in rats and mice web antagonizes the reserpine and apomorphineinduced HT potentiates the behavioral effect of dopa and DOPS as well as the trhinduced hyperthermia piracetam was only ERP in the RES and dopa tests web is inactive in immobility test of porsolt et al it enhances the hind limb FR of the spinal rat this effect being antagonized by prazosin and cyproheptadine it exerts no effect on head twitches induced by lhydroxytryptophan the studied compound increases the noradrenaline and dopamine and turnover in the forebrain and BS web given repeatedly potentiates the clonidineinduced aggressiveness and has no effect on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by damphetamine the results indicate that in a number of tests web acts like other ADs but in others not moreover they suggest that this action isat least partlymediated by the central noradrenaline system
TP,thinprep,TS-3389,the TP imaging system tis is an automated system that assists cytotechnologists in the primary screening of thinprep liquid based cervical samples between june and april four experienced cytotechnologists participated in the T0 in which the duration of the screening procedure was timed for each of the slides included in every slide fields of view were reviewed and the samples that contained potentially abnormal cells were fully screened the screening time was reduced by mean p by manual rescreening of the negative tis samples abnormal cells were found in samples false negative rate in every case the abnormal cells had been identified by the scanner but misinterpreted by the cytotechnologist these findings stressed the importance of carefulness in the interpretation of the marked fields and beyond that helped the cytotechnologists and pathologists to have more confidence in the automated system
SR,superior rectus,TS-3390,four patients with an ipsilateral hypertropia T3 CE consistent with superior rectus muscle overaction were identified between march and april operative trauma was the most likely causative factor as other likely conditions were excluded the proposed pathogenesis for all cases is similar to that of botulinum typea toxin therapy a transient postoperative weakness of the ipsilateral VPI rectur muscle leads to a contracture or strengthening of the ipsilateral antagonist the SR muscle possible mechanisms of injury that would result in a transient VPI rectus muscle palsy would include anesthetic myotoxicity or direct trauma to the muscle and related structures from the retrobulbar i.t. or subconjunctival injection surgical MI consisting of an ipsilateral superior rectus muscle recession and posterior fixation sutures when the vertical incomitance was large yielded excellent results in restoring single binocular vision possible preventive measures would include using a minimal volume of anesthetic along with careful needle placement
ACC,accident compensation corporation,TS-3391,a percent random sample of practising dentists in new zealand was invited to CR a questionnaire aimed at determining their opinions on the effects of changes to ACC regulations on dental practice and patient access to treatment seventysix percent of those surveyed returned the survey form the results suggested that the introduction of a fee schedule for dental treatment in restricted practitioners treatment decisions and prevented some patients from receiving what was considered to be ideal care largely on the basis of cost although the scheduled fee did not always cover the cost of treatment many practitioners absorbed this shortfall however since the percent cut in fees payed by acc which was introduced in practitioners are now finding it necessary to charge the patient for the amount not covered by acc dentists state that this is further restricting the kind of treatment they can provide and that patients can afford some patients are now unable to have any treatment for dental injuries resulting from accidents as they cannot afford it some practitioners feel that the introduction of a fee schedule and the requirement of a patient contribution to treatment costs have had some positive effects but the majority feel that significant barriers to treatment have been created by the acc changes
NC,north carolina,TS-3392,water collected at CS in the neuse river estuary of NC was analyzed for total viable counts on three isolation media trypticase soy agar tsa marine agar sabouraud agar and total hydrocarbons by fluorescence spectroscopy counts of x to x cellsml were found for total heterotrophs well within the range commonly reported for marine and estuarine waters generally marine agar gave higher counts than tsa at stations with salinities greater than mgml tsa gave higher counts than marine agar at sites with salinities less than mgml the microbial species isolated on the three media agree well with those previously reported for estuarine microbial communities water analyses using xad resin and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in the range of to ngml representatives of the microbial species isolated from these communities were tested individually for their ability to grow using kerosene as a sole source of carbon and energy at all but two stations the majority of the species isolated were able to grow on HCs indicating that this ability is widespread even in environments not subjected to high C2 of hydrocarbon pollution
EM,eye muscle,TS-3393,the efficacy of pharmacologic agents for prevention and control of oxygenderived free radical damage in ischemiareperfusion injury of the spinal cord was assessed in a swine MM of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic crossclamping animals were exposed to minutes of ischemia that induced lethal irreversible injury and paraplegia the exp groups were as follows group a n control group receiving no pharmacologic IG b n deferoxamine mgkgday i.v. over to hours before ischemia group c n allopurinol pretreatment mgkgday for days and group d n superoxide dismutase units administered with units before removal of the aortic crossclamp and units over minutes of reperfusion PT hypertension was controlled with sodium nitroprusside and volume SD the methods of assessment were neurologic by a modified tarlov criteria and blood flow by radiolabeled microspheres results of blood flow assessment confirmed a true ICM episode of T2 for all animals in all groups the blood flow fell significantly during ischemia p less than and a hyperemic response was evident in the early reperfusion period all animals in control group a were paraplegic the group b deferoxamine results were superior had WHO function on a modified tarlov scale with animals in the group standoss react with antigens of skeletal muscle and CL eye muscle antigens reacting with patients antibodies are localised in plasma membranes and in CM of smooth reticulum affinity purification of solubilised porcine eye muscle membrane proteins on a column with immunoglobulins from pooled SS of patients resulted in fold purification of the antigen the sensitivity of elisa was not significantly increased by the use of affinity purified antigen however some of previously negative ophthalmopathy sera gave positive reaction porcine EM membrane proteins were separated by sds page and transferred to nitrocellulose the reactions of electroblotted proteins with sera from patients with graves ophthalmopathy and also sera from HCs shown very complex DP there was not a single antigen or antigens reacting only with antibodies present in sera of ophthalmopathy patients and not in controls patients sera reacted more often than control sera with an antigen of about kda the reaction of sera from some patients with proteins about and kda were stronger than between these proteins and control sera no changes in the DP of reaction between antibodies and EM antigens were noticed in serum of the same graves patient with or without ophthalmopathy during one year follow up and treatment regardless of clinical course of the disease when human EM membrane fractions from tissue obtained during strabismus repair or at autopsy was used for immunoblotting smaller number of proteins reacted with autoantibodies again there was no single antigen or antigens reacting with antibodies from sera of all GO patients sera of some patients reacted with antigens about kda not recognized by controls the results of present T0 show that the anti EM antibodies are present in some of GO patientsabstract truncated at words
SAP,stressactivated protein,TS-3394,reactive oxygen species ros can be generated following cell stimulation and function as intracellular signaling molecules to determine signaling components involved in ros induction human u blood cells grown in serum were exposed to SF media it was previously reported that SS withdrawal sw killed cells by elevating cellular ros levels this T0 showed that sw activates phosphoinositide kinase pik pik activation was evident T3 the ros C2 began increasing and an antioxidant blockade of this increase resulted in pik activation suppression interestingly the inhibition of pik activityactivation using either its TPS inhibitor or dominantnegative mutant att the subsequent additional increase in the ros levels these results suggest that swinduced ros activate pik which in turn promotes the process leading to ros accumulation the present study also revealed that both ros and pik support swinduced cell death by activating SAP kinasecjun NT kinase sapkjnk overall it appears that sw triggers a positive mutual interaction between ros and pik which amplifies signals required for the induction of an sapkdependent death pathway
CC,coronary calcification,TS-3395,cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients and current research indicates that it might be linked to high SS phosphorus C2 and calciumphosphorus product the severe osteopathy known to exist in endstage renal disease esrd patients is often coupled with an inability of bone to handle excess calcium loads this might predispose to overflow and deposition of calcium and phosphate crystals in various soft tissues and in particular the cardiovascular apparatus atherosclerosis is a slow process that expands in the context of the arterial intimal SL and it is for the most part associated with extracellular calcification EB tomography ebt is a radiological technique utilized to noninvasively visualize this silent marker of atherosclerosis VC several investigations conducted in nonesrd patients have conclusively demonstrated that CC indicates a high risk for cardiac events as ebt allows precise estimates of the extent of vascular and valvular calcification it might become an important clinical tool in esrd patients to assess the effect of excess calcium and phosphate load in soft tissues estimate the cardiovascular risk of events and gauge the effectiveness of therapy
NP,nucleoproteins,TS-3396,we examined the interaction of NP with thyroid response PE tre by southwestern method the proteins that bound specifically to tre were detected at apparent molecular weight about and after digestion of NP blotted on pvdf membrane with Endo h the amounts of tre that bound to the NP were increased these results show that carbohydrate moieties of NP have an important role on the interaction of the nucleoproteins with tre t stimulated the IB of tre to nucleoproteins the amount of t binding to NP was changed during liver regeneration these results indicate that t changes the interaction of the nucleoproteins with tre so t serves as a transducing signal to modulate the gene regulating activity of trebinding NP liver regeneration may be controlled by these modification of interaction of nucleoproteins with dna
MF,mossy fibre,TS-3397,AA has been proposed as an intercellular messenger in the nervous system it is released when glu acts on postsynaptic receptors potentiates nmda receptor currents and depresses glu uptake here we report the effects of AA on nonnmda receptor currents studied by wholecell clamping isolated neurons and neurons in tissue slices in cultured cerebellar granule cells and in freshly isolated HPC pyramidal cells arachidonic acid decreased the current produced by iontophoresed ampa this depression was not due to increased desensitization of the ampa receptor in cerebellar slices AA depressed the nonnmda component of the synaptic current at the MF to granule cell and the parallel fibre to purkinje cell synapses however this depression was not always seen possibly because the lipophilic arachidonic acid is absorbed by superficial cells in the slice and does not reach the synapse being studied depression of nonnmda receptor currents by arachidonic acid may reflect the presence of an AA acid binding site on the nonnmda receptor but nonnmda receptor subunits show much less CS homology with fatty acid binding proteins than does the nmda receptor

EMS,ethyl methanesulfonate,TS-3412,using the sexlinked recessive lethal mutation screen a synergistic interaction is observed for mutations induced by chemical mutagens EMS and dimethylnitrosamine and the transposable dnaelement system of hybrid dysgenesis in spermatogonial cells of drosophila melanogaster although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown these results suggest that some chemical mutagens may induce transpositions hybrid dysgenic cells may be more sensitive to chemically induced genetic damage or hybrid dysgenesis may inhibit the efficiency of repair of chemically induced lesions
LA,lactic acidosis,TS-3413,renal cell carcinoma rcc is a rare pediatric renal cancer recent molecular genetic studies discovered a tumorspecific mutation involving translocation of a transcription factor tfe in a subset of pediatric rcc with distinct histopathology we reported a case of a yearold boy with rcc associated with tfe translocation resulting in a prcctfe F0 gene interestingly the case carried a maternally inherited mitochondrial dna mtdna alteration at the position which is usually found in melas mitochondrial encephalopathy LA and strokelike episodes syndrome ag although evidence of somatic alterations in mtdna existed in various cancers association between inherited mtdna mutation and pediatric renal CA has not been reported our case provided the first evidence of a cooccurrence between a germ line mutation in mtdna and the somatic mutation of pediatric rcc with this information we speculated a role of mitochondria mutation in the pathogenesis of this cancer
PE,potential energy,TS-3414,whereas conical intersections between PE surfaces of bound states are well known the interaction of shortlived states has been investigated only rarely here we present several systematically constructed MM hamiltonians to T0 the topology of intersecting complex potential SE surfaces describing shortlived states we find the general phenomenon of doubly intersecting complex energy surfaces ie there are two points instead of one as in the case of bound states where the PE surfaces coalesce in addition seams of intersections of the respective real and imaginary parts of the PE surfaces emanate from these two points using the sigma and pi resonance states of the chloroethene anion as a practical example we demonstrate that our CR linear MM hamiltonian is able to reproduce all phenomena found in explicitly calculated ab initio complex PE surfaces

SI,substantia innominata,TS-3419,the organization of the magnocellular basal nucleus mbn projection to cerebral SC in the rat has been studied by using cytoarchitectonic immunohistochemical and retrograde and anterograde transport methods the distribution of retrogradely labeled basal forebrain neurons after cortical injections of WGA-HRP was essentially identical to that of neurons IF immunohistochemically for choline acetyltransferase these large micrometers perikaryon diameter multipolar SN were found scattered through a number of basal forebrain cell CG MS nucleus nucleus of the diagonal band of broca magnocellular PON SI and globus pallidus this peculiar CSD mimics the locations of pathways by which descending cortical fibers enter the diencephalon each CA was innervated by a characteristic subset of mbn SN always located in close association with descending cortical fibers in many instances anterogradely labeled descending cortical fibers appeared to ramify into diffuse terminal fields among mbn SN which were retrogradely labeled by the same cortical injection double label experiments using VA transport of fluorescent dyes confirmed that mbn SN innervate restricted cortical fields anterograde autoradiographic transport studies after injections of hamino acids into mbn revealed that mbn axons reach CBF cortex primarily via two pathways the medial pathway arising from the medial septal nucleus nucleus of the diagonal band and medial SI and GP mbn neurons curves dorsally rostral to the diagonal band nucleus up to the genu of the corpus callosum most of the fibers either directly enter medial frontal cortex or turn back over the genu of the CC into the superficial medial cingulate bundle many of these SF enter anterior cigulate or retrosplenial SC but some can be traced back to the splenium of the CC where a few enter VC but most turn ventrally and sweep into the HPC formation here they are joined by other SF which at the genu of the corpus callosum remain ventrally located and run caudally through the dorsal fornix into the hippocampus the lateral pathway arises in part from MS diagonal band and MC POA neurons whose axons sweep laterally through the SI to innervate primarily piriform perirhinal and endorhinal SC some of these fibers may also enter the hippocampal formation from the entorhinal cortex via the VP subiculumabstract truncated at words
DC,distensibility,TS-3420,hypertension is known to be associated with an increase in the walllumen ratio wl of the resistance arteries growth eutrophic remodelling and changes in arterial DC can all contribute to an increase wl WS may stimulate growth whereas remodelling andor reduced DC may be the result of prolonged contraction impaired or overwhelmed pressureinduced myogenic constriction causing increased WS may explain the small i.a. growth seen in diabetes and secondary hypertension respectively we find that small i.a. growth is a greater predictor of cardiovascular events than an increased wl
CM,ciliary muscle,TS-3421,CM CF in patients with adies syndrome was studied retrospectively in patients and prospectively in patients when a careful history was taken two thirds of the patients had ciliary musclerelated symptoms most of the patients with adies syndrome had a moderate accomodative paresis but there was a strong tendency for the ciliary muscle to recover with time many patients showed a tonicity of accommodation especially those who had had the condition for several years astigmatism could be induced with accommodation in one third of patients this may be related to segmental paralysis of the CM seventythree percent of the patients showed supersensitivity of the CM in the involved eye when both eyes were treated with a mixture of pilocarpine hydrochloride and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose isopto carpine this may be a clinical aid in diagnosing adies syndrome two patients were found to have bilateral ciliary muscle dysfunction but only unilateral pupillary CA these two patients may have had a pupilsparing adies syndrome
PA,pseudoaneurysm,TS-3422,during insertion of the double lumen tube in patients with cervical vertebod flow on doppler was present the diagnosis of an aneurysm was made the PA of the left gastric i.a. was embolized with histoacryl and lipiodol and the SA was embolized with coils at the location of the pseudoaneurysm to prevent hemorrhage follow up eus confirmed the cessation of blood flow from the PA clinicians encountering a gastric SM tumorlike protrusion in a patient with chronic one should use eus to investigate the possibility of a PA which must be treated as quickly as possible once identified
MS,mass spectrometric,TS-3423,unification of the screening protocols for a wide range of doping agents has become an important issue for doping control laboratories this T0 presents the OD and validation of a generic liquid chromatographytimeofflight mass spectrometry lctofms screening method of small molecule analytes from various categories of prohibited substances stimulants narcotics diuretics betaagonists betablockers hormone antagonists and modulators glucocorticosteroids and anabolic agents it is based on a singlestep liquidliquid SE of hydrolyzed urine and the use of a rapidresolution liquid chromatographyhighresolution timeofflight MS system acquiring continuous full scan data ESI in the positive mode was used validation parameters consisted of identification capability limit of PCD specificity ion suppression SE recovery repeatability and mass accuracy detection criteria were established on the basis of retention time reproducibility and mass accuracy the suitability of the methodology for doping control was demonstrated with positive urine samples the preventive role of the method was proved by the case where full scan acquisition with accurate mass measurement allowed the retrospective reprocessing of acquired data from past doping control samples for the PCD of a designer drug the stimulant methylhexanamine which resulted in rereporting a number of stored samples as positives for this particular substance when initially they had been reported as negatives

ARC,arcuate nuclei,TS-3425,this study tested the hypothesis that the hypothalamus participates in the decompensatory phase of hemorrhage by measuring fos immunoreactivity and by inhibiting neuronal activity in selected hypothalamic nuclei with lidocaine or cobalt chloride previously we reported that inactivation of the arcuate nucleus inhibited but did not fully prevent the fall in arterial pressure evoked by hypotensive hemorrhage here we report that hemorrhage mlg body weight over min induced fos expression in a high percentage of cells in the PVH supraoptic and ARC of the hypothalamus as shown previously lower densities of fos immunoreactive cells were also found in the MPO area mpoa anterior hypothalamus lateral hypothalamus lh dorsomedial hypothalamus VMH vmh and PH BL injection of lidocaine Î¼l or Î¼l or cobalt chloride mm Î¼l into the tuberal portion of the lh immediately before hemorrhage was initiated reduced the magnitude of HH and bradycardia significantly lidocaine i.t. into the vmh also attenuated the fall in arterial pressure and HR rate evoked by hemorrhage although inactivation of the mpoa or rostral lh was ineffective these findings indicate that hemorrhage activates SN throughout much of the hypothalamus and that a relatively broad area of the hypothalamus extending from the arcuate nucleus laterally through the caudal vmh and tuberal lh plays an important role in the decompensatory phase of hemorrhage
FD,fascia dentata,TS-3426,golgis only paper on the pes hippocampi L1 was published in and then reprinted and translated a number of times in it he stated that the FD provided the best information available to date on how nerve SF and nerve cells are related based on the revolutionary silver chromate method he had introduced a decade earlier golgi described two sources of axons from the FD one consisted of direct axons from the granule cells and the other coonsisted of indirect axons from a diffuse neural net or reticulum that was generated from collaterals of the direct axons the same basic arrangement was described for ammons horn but neither was illustrated and it is important to bear in mind that this work was published before the neuron doctrine and law of functional polarity were elaborated in the s
PM,medial pulvinar,TS-3427,the topographic CSD of PM neuronal populations projecting to area a and to posterior cingulate gyrus area was investigated with retrograde axonal transport of fluorescent dyes in an initial stage separate injections of fast blue and diamidinoyellow were placed in area a two segregated backfilled cell populations were observed in the cingulate gyrus revealing a topographic distribution of corticocortical connections in a second stage the two dyes were injected in area a and in the posterior cingulate gyrus T3 injections in two cortical subareas previously shown to be in topographic correspondence the two projecting populations observed in the PM overlapped extensively in the case of i.v. in two regions not topographically correspondent the two medial pulvinar populations were found to be segregated these findings reveal that within both posterior parietal cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus subareas which are in topographic correspondence receive projections from a common region of the PM

RB,rose bengal,TS-3429,efficient phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments pos membranes by retinal pigment epithelium rpe plays a key role in biological renewal of these highly peroxidizable structures here we tested whether photodynamic treatment mediated by merocyanine mc RB or a zincsubstituted chlorophyllide inhibited phagocytic activity of arpe cells in vitro specific phagocytosis of fluoresceinisothiocyanatelabeled pos isolated from cow retinas and nonspecific phagocytosis of fluorescent polystyrene beads were measured by FC photodynamic treatment mediated by all three photosensitizers with subthreshold doses induced significant inhibition of the cellspecific phagocytosis the nonspecific phagocytosis was inhibited by photodynamic treatment mediated only by mc the inhibition of phagocytosis was a reversible phenomenon and T3 h the photodynamically treated cells exhibited phagocytic activity that was comparable with that of UT cells this study provides proof of principle that subthreshold PDT of arpe cells with appropriate photosensitizers is a convenient exp RPA for in vitro study of the effects of oxidative stress on TPS phagocytic activity of rpe cells we postulate that oxidative damage to key components of the cell phagocytic machinery may be responsible for severe impairment of its activity which can lead to retinal degeneration
NHS,normal human subjects,TS-3430,we determined the metabolic clearance and production rates of dihydroxyvitamin d in four normal healthy adults we also examined the excretion of radioactivity in stool urine and bile after the intravenous administration of hdihydroxyvitamin d to human subjects dihydroxyvitamin d is rapidly cleared from the plasma with a halflife of approximately min mean se the metabolic CL of dihydroxyvitamin d was litersday with a production rate of microgramsday mean se within day mean se of the po dose had appeared in the stool by day of the dose had appeared in the feces within hr of the po dose appeared in the urine of the dose had appeared in the urine within days the biliary excretion of dihydroxyvitamin d was studied in two subjects by h of the administered dose had appeared in the bile the metabolites present in bile feces and urine were much more polar than dihydroxyvitamin d these results demonstrate that dihydroxyvitamin d is rapidly cleared from plasma and is excreted in the feces probably via the bile and urine of NHS
CR,circadian rhythm,TS-3431,the circadian rhythms in the MICs of maltase and lactase of the small intestine were examined at various stages of postnatal development in rats when the rats were fed AL no circadian NC in the enzyme MICs was found during the suckling period or the weaning period however several days T3 the time of weaning the enzymes showed the same circadian changes as in adult rats with higher MICs at night after weaning when the rats were fed only during the daytime the phase of the enzyme rhythm shifted about half a day and the highest activity was observed around feeding time however during the suckling period no CR in the enzyme acvities was found even when the rats were allowed to feed only during a restricted time of the day
BR,biochemical response,TS-3432,BR stressors results in an increase of HPA activity before knowing the corticosteroid levels in saliva in a stressful situation baselines salivary C2 should be established a method for simultaneous determination of five corticosteroids was developed validated and applied to pig saliva at farms the method employs SPE spe coupled with cleanup extraction step using Si cartridge in the same step followed by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry lcmsms using ESI esi in positive mode the overall method quantification limits range from to Î¼gl for the enrichment of ml saliva samples and analyte recoveries are between and rsd some AF studied were pig sex breeds and time at farm the analytical method clearly shows that crl and crs levels of respectively and Î¼gl in saliva can be indicative of maxima nonstress levels in different pig breeds at farm
RR,respiratory rates,TS-3433,obesity has long been recognized as having significant effects on respiratory function the topic has been studied for at least the last half century and some clear patterns have emerged obese patients tend to have higher RR and lower tidal volumes total respiratory system compliance is reduced for a variety of reasons which will be discussed lung volumes tend to be decreased especially expiratory reserve volume spirometry gas exchange and airway resistance all tend to be relatively well preserved when adjusted for lung volumes patients may be mildly hypoxaemic possibly due to ventilationperfusion mismatching at the base of the lungs where microatelectasis is likely to occur weight loss leads to a reversal of these changes for all of these changes the CSD of fat that is upper versus lower body may be more important than body mass index
TI,thermodynamic integration,TS-3434,ordered water molecules bound to protein surfaces or in proteinligand interfaces are frequently observed by crystallography the investigation of the impact of such conserved water molecules on protein stability and ligand affinity requires detailed structural dynamic and thermodynamic analyses several crystal structures of the legume lectin concanavalin a con a bound to closely related carbohydrate ligands show the presence of a conserved water molecule that mediates ligand binding exp thermodynamic and theoretical studies have examined the role of this conserved water in the complexation of con a with a synthetic analog of the natural trisaccharide in which a hydroxyethyl side chain replaces the hydroxyl group at the c position in the central mannosyl residue molecular modeling earlier indicated clarke c woods r j glushka j cooper a nutley m a boons gj j am chem soc that the hydroxyl group in this synthetic side chain could occupy a position equivalent to that of the conserved water and thus might displace it an interpretation of the exp thermodynamic data which was consistent with the MSD of the conserved water was also presented the current work reports the crystal structure of con a with this synthetic ligand and shows that even though the position and interactions of the conserved water are distorted this key water is not displaced by the hydroxyethyl moiety this new structural data provides a firm basis for MD and TI calculations whose results indicate that differences in van der waals contacts insertion SE rather than electrostatic interactions charging energy are fundamentally responsible for the lower affinity of the synthetic ligand when combined with the new crystallographic data this T0 provides a straightforward interpretation for the lower affinity of the synthetic analog specifically that it arises primarily from weaker interactions with the protein via the positionally perturbed conserved water this interpretation is fully consistent with the experimental observations that the free energy of binding is enthalpy driven that there is both less enthalpic gain and less entropic penalty for binding the synthetic ligand relative to the NK trisaccharide and that the entropic component does not arise from releasing an ordered water molecule from the protein surface to the bulk solvent

DR,dietary records,TS-3437,cryptomeria japonica is one of the most important forest tree species in japan to increase the demand for domestic timber broad uses related to the functional attributes of c japonica must be developed several studies have examined the usefulness of c japonica in terms of its biological MICs but a comprehensive study subjecting all parts of the c japonica plant to the same solvent for extraction has not been done here methanol extractions from the leaves branches bearing branches male flowers female flowers cones bark heartwood sapwood pith rhizomes roots and pollen were subjected to several in vitro and research hospital individualistic weightloss diet programs were implemented three mealsday for one group and six mealsday for the other group with a threemonth followup anthropometric measurements and hour DR were taken for each week during the study period some biochemical parameters lipid profile fasting blood glucose FI were analyzed at the beginning and at the end of the study results fortythree participants finished the study period body weight body mass index fat mass kg fat mass percentage and waist circumference cm decreased significantly in both CG p while fat free mass kg and body water l did not NC significantly p only SS fasting insulin C2 decreased significantly in the six mealsday group p whatever the differences between the initial and final values of body weight body composition and biochemical parameters they were similar between the CG p only the decrease in fasting insulin C2 in the sixmeal group was found higher than that of the threemeal group conclusion in conclusion body weight BC and lipid profiling are not affected by the number of meals when weightloss diets are prepared with adequate energy restrictions and sufficient and balanced nutrition
GA,general anesthesia,TS-3438,postoperative NV ponv is a commonly observed adverse effect of GA recently ondansetron a new serotonin hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist was shown to be effective in the prophylaxis and prevention of chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting in children and adults as well as of ponv in adults the aim of the current T0 was to evaluate the capacity of ondansetron to prevent ponv in pediatric patients
ET,endometrial thickness,TS-3439,the purpose of this work was to correlate the histologic findings and ultrasonographic variables of the endometrium in relation to corporal weight and body fat distribution in two CG of women one with posmenopausal uterine one and other under hormonal replacement therapy hrt thirty one posmenopausal women were studied and divided into two CG i women with posmenopausal uterine bleeding n and ii women with hrt conjugated Es and chlormadinone n in both groups TV ultrasound was accomplished the same day previous to the EB eb the eb was taken in the group i the day they attended the hospital referring TV one and in GI a statistical significant rho was found among the corporal weight and histologic findings and among the endometrial refringence and the histologic findings in group ii there was a statistical significant rho among the body fat CSD and endometrial refringence and among the ET and histologic findings it can be concluded that in women with posmenopausal one the corporal weight influences the histologic findings and the refringence is related with histologic findings while those under hrt is more important the body fat CSD over endometrial refringence and the ET is related with histologic findings
NHS,normal healthy subjects,TS-3440,an increased occurrence of L1 depressive disorder has been reported in tinnitus patients and of tinnitus in depressive patients involvement of several brodmann Az bas has been reported in tinnitus perception the aim of this study was to assess the regional cerebral blood flow rcbf changes in depressed patients with and without tinnitus the rcbf CSD at rest was compared among patients with a lifetime prevalence of L1 depressive disorder of whom had severe tinnitus and NHS mtchexamethylenepropylene amine oxime mtchmpao single photon emission computed tomography spect using a threeheaded gamma camera was performed and the uptake in PET subvolumes of the brain bilaterally was assessed by a computerized BB C1 decreased rcbf in right frontal lobe ba p the left parietal lobe ba p and the left visual association SC ba p was found in tinnitus patients compared with nontinnitus patients the proportion of tinnitus patients with pronounced rcbf alterations in one or more of the temporal lobe bas was increased compared to gender matched controls p and patients without tinnitus p positive correlations were found between trait anxiety scales from the KSP and rcbf in tinnitus patients only in three limbic bas p and inverse correlations in nontinnitus patients only in five bas subserving auditory perception and processing p rcbf differences between healthy controls and depressed patients with and without tinnitus were found in this T0 the rcbf alterations were distributed in the cortex and were particularly specific in the AEP SC these findings suggest that taking audiological PS into account may yield more consistent results between rcbf studies of depression
AP,antiplasmin,TS-3441,uPA upa is initially produced by cells as a singlechain F0 proupa which can be cleaved by the serine protease plasmin to form the twochain molecule upa this latter protease efficiently converts the inactive zymogen plasminogen into plasmin cell surface IB of both proupa and plasminogen is known to enhance the rate of PA it has been postulated that this may be due in part to an enhanced plasminmediated FB activation of proupa this study directly demonstrates the enhancement by cells of this feedback activation loop by showing that upa is generated more rapidly from proupa and plasminogen in the presence of human promonocytic u cells than it is under fluidphase conditions moreover the enhanced activation of proupa and plasminogen observed in the presence of cells was significantly less susceptible to inhibition by AP finally the presence of cells not only potentiated the production of PL as measured using a plasminspecific peptide substrate it also potentiated the cleavage of a NK protein ATP ilabeled recombinant interferongamma even in the presence of alpha AP or AMG these results demonstrate that cellassociated plasmin mediates a positive feedback amplification of PA and thereby potentiates the proteolysis of NK PL substrates even in the presence of plasma PIs
PS,pachytene spermatocytes,TS-3442,the human cyclin a gene is highly expressed in PS and is essential for spermatogenesis to analyze mechanisms of cyclin a gene expression in vivo we cloned a kb fragment of the promoter UP of the cdna of enhanced green FL protein egfp four lines of transgenic mice were generated that carried the Tg cyclin a promoter activity in the organs of the transgenic mice was analyzed using FM and FC expression of egfp was seen in male germ cells of all four mu lines SPG at the basal membrane expressed low C2 of egfp but bright green fluorescence was present in spermatocytes entering meiosis interestingly a further sharp increase in egfp expression was found in SPC approximately at the stage of the MI egfp C2 stayed high thereafter and egfp was present in mature spermatozoa a portion of ckit expressing cells in the testis also expressed egfp indicating cyclin a promoter activity in a subpopulation onmediated organellar fission machineries of eukaryotes
FP,fusion peptide,TS-3443,an ltbst ltbst FP was constructed by genetically joining the terminus of a synthetic gene coding for the HS enterotoxin st of escherichia coli to the terminus of the gene coding for the binding S1 of the HL enterotoxin ltb of e coli an eightaminoacid prolinecontaining linker was included between the ltb and st moieties an aroa mutant of salmonella dublin transformed with a plasmid carrying this genetic construct was shown to express a fusion peptide with antigenic determinants of both ltb and st mice were immunized orally with this strain or with a control CS expressing just ltb from the same plasmid sera and mucosal secretions were obtained and analyzed for the presence of SS immunoglobulin g and mucosal immunoglobulin a that were able to recognize ltb and st by ELISA CA elisa and more importantly were able to neutralize native st in the suckling mouse assay sera and mucosal secretions from animals immunized with the strain expressing the ltbst F0 exhibited detectable elisa CR against ltb but not against native st however even in the absence of detectable elisa CR both sera and mucosal secretions from these animals were able to neutralize the biological activity of native st in the suckling mouse assay these findings are important because they demonstrate the OD of mucosal protection against st by oral immunization with a genetic F0 delivered by a bacterial vector
SN,sensory neuron,TS-3444,an olfactory SN osn expresses selectively one member from a repertoire of approximately odorant receptor or genes and projects its axon to a specific glomerulus in the olfactory bulb both processes are here recapitulated by mor and m or minigenes introduced into mice minigenes of kb and as short as kb are selectively expressed by neurons that do not coexpress the endogenous gene but coproject their axons to the same glomeruli deletion of a bp UP region in the mor minigene abolishes expression in this region we recognize sequence motifs conserved in many or genes transgenic lines expressing the or in ectopic epithelial zones form ectopic glomeruli which also receive input from osns expressing the cognate endogenous receptor this suggests a recruitment through homotypic interactions between osns expressing the same or
SF,space flight,TS-3445,criteria for SF crew and passenger selection should be based on the following three considerations freedom from impairing disease ability to perform mission requirements and motivation to undertake the mission chronologic age of itself is not a valid criterion forecast life expectancy and vitality relative to mission duration are valid criteria and can be applied on an individual basis using modern assessment techniques the good health and vitality characterizing the upper ages of todays population widens the opportunity to utilize increasingly broad fields of experience and skills in future space flights further enhancing the odds for total mission accomplishment
DR,dietrestricted,TS-3446,to study the role of nuclear RII proteins in mediating dietary effects hepatic ccaatenhancer binding protein cebp mrna and transcription rate were measured for cebpalpha and cebpbeta in nutritional states that profoundly alter SE metabolism and growth weanling male SDRs were fed riboflavinsufficient r or deficient r diets for wk a DR pairfed rp group was maintained concurrently because riboflavindeficient rats voluntarily decrease food consumption by approximately compared with controls half of each group was deprived of food for h the wk treatment altered hepatic levels of both proteins p cebpalpha protein levels were increased twofold by diet restriction c ebpbeta protein C2 were increased nearly threefold by riboflavin deficiency starvation had no significant effect on the expression of either protein we investigated the mechanism responsible for increased protein by measuring steadystate mrna C2 and transcription rates for cebpalpha and cebpbeta in both isoforms increases in mrna were parallel to increases in transcription rates the nutrientinduced changes in protein mrna and transcription rates could not be attributed only to alterations in serum glucagon or insulin concentrations we conclude that cebpalpha and cebpbeta expression responds to diet but may involve different dietary signals for diet restriction vs riboflavin deficiency the dietary regulation of cebpalpha and cebpbeta expression seems to be controlled in part at the level of gene transcription and cebpalpha and cebpbeta nuclear proteins by virtue of their increased quctions in an enormous diversity of developmental processes and its dysfunction is implicated in many cancers
SI,sucraseisomaltase,TS-3447,a case of congenital sucraseisomaltase deficiency in man was investigated an intestinal biopsy sample from a yearold girl lacked sucrase but possessed low residual isomaltase activity immunoelectron microscopy with monoclonal antibodies to SI in biopsy samples from HS revealed that SI was confined predominantly to the MVM of enterocytes and there was minimal labeling of the GA in the patient immunoreactive SI was found almost exclusively in about three transgolgi cisternae and associated vesicular structures while no specific labeling was associated with the microvillus membrane IP experiments with iodinated mucosal homogenates and a mixture of four monoclonal antibodies to SI revealed absence of enzyme subunits in the patients but presence of a mr protein that was also expressed in normal control biopsy specimens this protein presumably is the highmannose precursor of sucraseisomaltase additional proteins of mr found in the patient but not in normal subjects might correspond to the CRM found in the GA of the patient overall the findings suggest that in the patient SI is synthesized and transported to the golgi apparatus where further transport is interrupted the data imply that signals in sucraseisomaltase that mediate its transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus differ from those mediating its transport from the GA to the cell surface
AL,annulate lamellae,TS-3448,AL al are stacked erderived CM containing nuclear pore complexlike structures whose fate and CF have remained a mystery during the short interphase of early embryonic cells al are rapidly delivered into the NE through fenestrations highlighting the remarkable dynamics of the NE
ODE,ordinary differential equation,TS-3449,mathematical modelling is a labour intensive process involving several iterations of testing on real data and manual MM modifications in biology the domain knowledge guiding MM development is in many cases itself incomplete and uncertain a L1 problem in this context is that biological systems are open missed or unknown external influences as well as erroneous interactions in the model could thus lead to severely misleading results here we introduce the dynamic elasticnet a data driven mathematical method which automatically detects such model errors in ODE ode models we demonstrate for real and simulated data how the dynamic elasticnet RPA can be used to automatically i reconstruct the error signal ii identify the target variables of model error and iii reconstruct the true system state even for incomplete or preliminary models our work provides a systematic computational method facilitating modelling of open biological systems under uncertain knowledge
TS,tetanic stimulation,TS-3450,intracellular recordings were obtained from SN in the motor SC mcx in which excitatory postsynaptic potentials epsps were evoked by microstimulation of the somatosensory SC scx and the ventrolateral nucleus vl of the thalamus the effects of combined tetanic stimulation of scx and vl on the amplitudes of these epsps were studied amplitudes of both corticocortical cc and thalamocortical tc epsps were potentiated after combined TS this potentiation occurred exclusively in SN that were located in the SF layers iiiii and that received direct input from both the scx and vl with both inputs synapsing in close proximity to each other in all cases the potentiation lasted until the electrode went out of the cell min mean sd the longest being min we therefore refer to this potentiation as LT potentiation ltp TS of the TH only did not produce ltp in neurons receiving direct input from the vl ltp was not induced in either cc or tc epsps in SN located in layer v andor in SN receiving longlatency cc epsxycholic acid resulted in decreased plasma cholestanol C2 and improvement of some central and peripheral neurophysiological parameters including eeg vep sep and conduction E/A due to the presence of cataracts ischemic HR disease premature atherosclerosis mental deterioration and OP usually found in old age ctx can be considered a useful model of premature ageing
BR,basic region,TS-3451,to explore the role of the hlh subdomain in bhlhz proteins we designed sets of minimalist proteins based on bhlhz protein max bhlhpas protein arnt and bzip protein cebp in the first the max bhlh and cebp leucine zipper were fused such that the leucine heptad repeats were not in register therefore the protein dimerization interface was disrupted maxbhlhcebp showed little ability to activate transcription from the ebox cacgtg in the yeast onehybrid assay and no ebox binding by quantitative fluorescence anisotropy maxbhlhcebps activity was significantly improved T3 library selection three amino acids randomized between hlh and leucine zipper despite the max bhlh and cebp zipper still being out of register a representative mutant gave a high nanomolar kd value for ebox IB thus selection proved to be a powerful tool for salvaging the flawed maxbhlhcebp although the outofregister mutants still did not achieve the strong dnabinding affinities displayed by their inregister counterparts arntbhlhcebp hybrids further demonstrated the importance of maintaining register as outofregister mutants showed no eboxresponsive activity whereas the inregister hybrid showed moderate activity in another design we eliminated the hlh altogether and fused the max BR to the cebp zipper to generate bziplike hybrids despite numerous designs and selections these hybrids possessed no eboxresponsive activity finally we tested the importance of the loop CS in maxbhlhz by fluorescence and circular dichroism in one mutant the loop was shortened by two residues in the other the lysdnabackbone interaction was abolished by mutation to gly both showed markedly decreased eboxbinding relative to maxbhlhz our results suggest that in contrast to the more rigid bzip the hlh is capable of significant conformational adaptation to enable generegulatory function and is required for protein dimerization and positioning the BR for dna recognition
MF,membrane filtration,TS-3452,the binding of rat CL RPs l l and l to s rrna was characterized by nitrocellulose MF binding could be saturated with the three proteins the apparent association constants ka measured at degrees c and degrees c ranged from to x m the molar ratio of ribosomal protein and rrna in the complex at saturation approximated indicating there is one binding site for each of the three proteins on the nucleic acid a large number of rat liver ribosomal proteins including some previously suspected of associating weakly did not form a complex with s rrna
LP,lateral posterior nucleus,TS-3453,a L1 GABA input to the dorsal thalamus arises from neurons in the RE nucleus trn which use gammaaminobutyric acid gaba as a neurotransmitter we examined the synaptic targets of trn terminals in the visual TH including the a lamina of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus lgn the medial interlaminar nucleus min the LP lp and the pulvinar nucleus pul to identify trn terminals we injected biocytin into the visual sector of the trn to label terminals by anterograde transport we then used postembedding immunocytochemical staining for gaba to distinguish trn terminals as biocytinlabeled gabapositive terminals and to distinguish the postsynaptic targets of trn terminals as gabanegative thalamocortical cells or gabapositive interneurons we found that in all nuclei the trn provides gabaergic input primarily to thalamocortical relay cells most of this input seems targeted to peripheral dendrites outside of glomeruli the trn does not appear to be a significant source of gabaergic input to interneurons in the visual thalamus we also examined the synaptic targets of the overall population of gabaergic axon terminals f profiles within these same regions of the visual TH and found that the trn contacts cannot account for all f profiles in addition to f contacts on the dendrites of TC cells which presumably include trn terminals another population of f profiles most likely interneuron axons provides input to gabaergic interneuron dendrites our results suggest that the trn terminals are ideally situated to modulate TC transmission by controlling the response mode of TC cells
FA,fibrinolytic activity,TS-3454,we critically evaluated the evidence for an association between venous TE and impaired FA as determined by global tests of fibrinolytic activity or specific tests for tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor a computerassisted and manual search was performed to retrieve all articles that reported on FA and A-V thromboembolism the strength of the evidence for an association was assessed by analysis of the design of individual studies with special attention directed to choice of controls and methods of diagnosis of venous TE it is concluded that for patients with symptomatic thrombosis the published evidence does not prove an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity and increased risk of thrombosis in contrast for postoperative thrombosis there is good evidence for an association between impaired fibrinolytic activity measured either preoperatively or postoperatively and increased risk of postoperative thrombosis whether this association is causal or coincidental is unclear since RCTs that used interventions to enhance FA produced inconsistent results
TD,thermodilution,TS-3455,in a series of experiments involving measurement of left VVI blood flow by TD in the CS a consistent but unexpected variation in calculated CSF related to respiration was seen in some patients the variation was small but in others it was as much as to discover its cause five patients were investigated prospectively with continuous RA atrial pressure monitoring during CF measurement and respiratory manoeuvres in three icecold saline was injected into the right atrium during respiratory manoeuvres while CS temperature was monitored continuously and the position of the catheter was monitored fluoroscopically the cause was found to be movement of the catheter such that thermistor approached the RA atrium and the R2 was therefore spurious we report these findings and discuss other known causes of inaccurate CF measurement using the thermodilution technique
GS,ginsenosides,TS-3456,ginsenosides the AS component of PG have been shown to evidence a variety of biological activities associated with HG obesity and type diabetes mellitus this study evaluated the effects of the ginsenosides rg and re on gl uptake and the GT system in mature tl cells the results demonstrated that the gl uptake of ginsenosides rg and re at concentrations of Âµm significantly increased by approximately â\x88¼ and â\x88¼ respectively furthermore the gl transporter glut mrna expression of GS rg and re at Âµm was increased by approximately â\x88¼ and fold respectively it was further confirmed in a series of experiments that ginsenosides rg and re stimulated the mrna expression of insulin receptor substrate irs and the expression of phosphatidylinositol kinase pikÎ± protein which is involved in downstream events in the insulin signaling pathway these findings demonstrate that GS rg and re may stimulate glucose uptake via the pik pathways involving irs further our results suggest that both of these GS might prove useful as effective antidiabetic and antihyperglycemic agents
BR,basic region,TS-3457,the human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoproteins gp and gp CF in cell entry by IB to cd and a chemokine receptor on the cell surface and orchestrating the direct fusion of the viral and target cell membranes on the virion surface three gp molecules associate noncovalently with the ectodomain of the gp trimer to form the env oligomer although an atomiclevel structure of a monomeric gp core has been determined the structure of the oligomer is unknown here the orientation of gp in the oligomer is modeled by using quantifiable criteria of carbohydrate exposure occlusion of conserved residues and steric considerations with regard to the binding of the NT antibody b applying similar modeling techniques to influenza virus hemagglutinin suggests a rotational accuracy for the oriented gp of better than degrees the MM shows that cd binds obliquely such that multiple cd molecules bound to the same oligomer have their membranespanning portions separated by at least a the chemokine receptor in contrast binds to a sterically restricted surface close to the trimer axis electrostatic analyses reveal a basic region which faces away from the virus toward the target CM and is conserved on core gp the electrostatic potentials of this region are strongly influenced by the overall charge but not the precise structure of the third variable v loop this dependence on charge and not structure may make electrostatic interactions between this BR and the cell difficult to target therapeutically and may also provide a means of viral escape from IS surveillance
LC,local control,TS-3458,we present patients with lip carcinoma treated with hdr needles with gy per fractions bid total dose gy threeyear causespecific survival and LC are and t t p acute and chronic reactions are like ldr cases we think that hdr results are equivalent to ldr
SOC,selforganized criticality,TS-3459,the presence of selforganized criticality in biology is often evidenced by a powerlaw scaling of event size distributions which can be measured by linear regression on logarithmic axes we show here that such a procedure does not necessarily mean that the system exhibits SOC we first provide an analysis of multisite local field potential lfp recordings of BB activity and show that event size distributions defined as negative lfp peaks can be close to powerlaw distributions however this result is not robust to change in PCD threshold or when tested using more rigorous statistical analyses such as the kolmogorovsmirnov test similar powerlaw scaling is observed for surrogate signals suggesting that powerlaw scaling may be a generic property of thresholded stochastic processes we next investigate this problem analytically and show that indeed stochastic processes can produce spurious powerlaw scaling without the presence of underlying SOC however this powerlaw is only apparent in logarithmic representations and does not survive more rigorous analysis such as the KS test the same analysis was also performed on an artificial network known to display SOC in this case both the graphical representations and the rigorous statistical analysis reveal with no ambiguity that the avalanche size is distributed as a powerlaw we conclude that logarithmic representations can lead to spurious powerlaw scaling induced by the stochastic nature of the phenomenon this apparent powerlaw scaling does not constitute a proof of SOC which should be demonstrated by more stringent statistical tests
TC,thyroid cancer,TS-3460,PTC TC ptc is the most common type of thyroid cancer with the rapid OD of genomewide association studies gwas many genome variants associated with susceptibility to ptc have been identified including the single nucleotide polymorphism rs q near foxe to evaluate the association between rs and ptc in different ethnicities and countries we conducted a metaanalysis using relatively largescale samples from studies n cases and controls by searching the pubmed and google scholar databases significant heterogeneity caused by different populations among the selected studies was observed the a S2 of rs polymorphism was shown to be highly associated with risk of TC with odds ratios of ci in all populations ci in caucasian populations and in asian populations compared to the dominant and recessive models we observed the highest odds ratio or ci in the homozygous MM these results revealed that the rs polymorphism is a risk factor for thyroid cancer
AR,acute allograft rejection,TS-3461,regulatory t treg cells play an important role in the maintenance of immune selftolerance and homeostasis we previously reported that neonatal cd TA have an intrinsic default mechanism to become treg neotreg cells in response to tcell receptor tcr stimulation however the underlying mechanisms are unclear and the effects of neotreg cells on regulating immune responses remain unknown due to their involvement in foxp regulation we examined the role of dna methyltransferase dnmt and dnmtb during the induction of neotreg cells in the foxpgfp mice the function of neotreg cells was assessed in an acute allograft rejection MM established in rag mice with allograft CT and transferred with syngeneic cd effector TA following ex vivo tcr stimulation the dnmt activity was increased threefold in AD cd t cells but not significantly increased in neonatal cells however adoptively transferred neotreg cells significantly prolonged cardiac allograft survival mean survival time days p and maintained foxp expression similar to natural treg cells the neotreg cells were hypomethylated at the conserved noncoding dna sequence locus of foxp compared with adult treg cells the dnmt antagonist azadeoxycytidine aza induced increased foxp expression in mature cd TA azainducible treg cells combined with continuous aza treatment prolonged GS these results indicate that the default pathway of neotreg cell differentiation is associated with reduced dnmt and dnmtb response to tcr stimulus the neotreg cells may be a strategy to alleviate AR
PDT,photodynamic treatment,TS-3462,PDT of CA cells in the presence of the sensitizer rose bengal at low concentration microm did not influence cell survival survival after min illumination cell damage was observed when mm glutathione was added together with the dye to the cell suspension a cell inactivation was achieved after min illumination no preincubation of the cells with the sensitizer was needed the mechanism of the photodynamic damage exerted by the combined action of rose bengal and glutathione was investigated using TPS quenchers the results suggest an enhancement involving stimulation of the singlet oxygen generation the short term yeast inactivation achieved by a low concentration of the dye and glutathione may find an application in the design of an efficient anticandidose treatment
TA,thoracic aorta,TS-3463,magnetic resonance imaging mri appears to provide at least as much diagnostic information as angiography in the DUE of acquired and congenital forms of disease of the great arteries since it can also be used to assess the tissues adjacent to the great arteries mri often provides a distinct diagnostic advantage over angiography in addition the recently introduced dynamic mri techniques may provide valuable information regarding hemodynamic abnormalities associated with diseases of the TA and the pulmonary arterial system
ROC,rocuronium,TS-3464,two methods of paralysis are available for rapid CS intubation rsi in the emergency department ed ON agents such as succinylcholine and nondepolarizing drugs such as ROC rocuronium is a useful alternative when succinylcholine is contraindicated contraindications to succinylcholine include allergy PH of malignant hyperthermia denervation syndromes and patients who are h post burn or crush injury nondepolarizing drugs have the advantage of causing less pain due to postparalysis myalgias
EC,eosinophilic cystitis,TS-3465,a yearold man presented with pollakisuria and miction pain the patient who had SBC was treated with transurethral resection and instillation of THP hydrochloride urinalysis revealed a marked increase in eosinophilic cells a cystoscopic examination revealed an ischemic lesion and hypervascular lesion throughout the bladder histological findings of biopsied bladder specimens showed EC bladder symptoms are improved with steroid administration
AC,adherent cells,TS-3466,when bovine lymph node cells are cultured for several days the adherent macrophage population increases by as much as tenfold this increase in cell number is primarily due to cell division which reaches a maximum on day or of culture although the presence of the nonadherent cells seems required for cell division we have been unable to detect a macrophage growth factor in either the nonadherent cell populations the AC were identified as macrophages based on positive esterase IF the presence of fc receptors betaglucuronidase activity and phagocytosis moreover these AC produced interleukin il T3 exposure to lipopolysaccharide in serumfree medium approximately macrophages were stimulated to produce about units of il in a hr period thus the bovine CL node preparation is a potential source of a C1 number of macrophages capable of dividing in culture and of producing il
PI,primary isolates,TS-3467,in many plantpathogen interactions resistance to disease is controlled by the interaction of plantencoded resistance r genes and pathogenencoded avirulence avr genes the interaction between tomato and the leaf mould pathogen cladosporium fulvum is an ideal system to study the molecular basis of pathogen perception by plants a total of four tomato genes for resistance to c fulvum cf cf cf and cf have been isolated from two genetically complex chromosomal loci their gene products recognize TPS c fulvumencoded avia PH of at least three aecb episodes in the previous year was reported by of ciptreated patients and of clatreated patients of PI positively identified and cultured from patients the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included haemophilus species moraxella catarrhalis enterobacteriaceae staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pneumoniae and PA betalactamase production was found in of haemophilus influenzae of haemophilus parainfluenzae and of m catarrhalis isolates thirtyfour percent of s pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin minimum GABA concentration or mgl among the patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were and for cip versus and for cla the differences between cip and cla did not reach statistical significance superinfections were reported significantly more frequently in clatreated versus ciptreated patients eradication rates for specific organisms for cip and cla respectively were haemophilus species and m catarrhalis and s pneumoniae and and enterobacteriaceae and drugrelated AEs occurred in of ciptreated patients and of clatreated patients cip mg bid had a higher but not statistically significant clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than cla mg bid in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicatedsevere aecb the causative bacterial pathogens of aecb appear to be evolving with a predominance of gramnegative and other resistant organisms observed thus antibiotic therapy for atrisk patients with aecb should include agents that have activity against gramnegative pathogens
DC,dynamic compression,TS-3468,the auditory model described in giguÃ¨re and woodland j acoust soc am is applied to the simulation of the descending paths to the peripheral ear an external FB unit regulates the average FR of inner hair cell afferent fibers via a simplified modeling of the dynamics of the AR to the middle ear and of the slow efferent innervation of the outer hair cells the terminal effector of the acoustic reflex system is the stapedial muscle which stiffens the middle ear and reduces vibration of the stapes up to db below hz the control function of the efferent system is realized by modulating the coupling gain between the inner HC cilia and the surrounding subtectoral fluid over a range of db the efferent system has the capability to regulate FR over selective tonotopic regions of the auditory nerve it operates at a lower target rate and has a faster response than the AR system the feedback unit leads to DC of speech cochleograms along both the time and frequency axes
CAP,capsaicin,TS-3469,in all mammals tissue inflammation leads to pain and behavioral sensitization to thermal and mechanical stimuli called hyperalgesia we studied pain mechanisms in the african naked molerat an unusual rodent species that lacks painrelated neuropeptides eg substance p in cutaneous sensory fibers naked molerats show a unique and remarkable lack of painrelated behaviors to two potent algogens acid and CAP furthermore when exposed to inflammatory insults or known mediators naked molerats do not display thermal hyperalgesia in contrast naked molerats do display nocifensive behaviors in the formalin test and show mechanical hyperalgesia T3 inflammation using EP we showed that primary afferent nociceptors in naked molerats are insensitive to acid stimuli consistent with the animals lack of acidinduced SMB acid transduction by sensory neurons is observed in birds amphibians and fish which suggests that this tranduction mechanism has been selectively disabled in the naked molerat in the course of its evolution in contrast nociceptors do respond vigorously to CAP and we also show that SNs express a transient receptor potential vanilloid channel ion channel that is capsaicin sensitive nevertheless the activation of capsaicinsensitive sensory SN in naked molerats does not produce painrelated SMB we show that capsaicinsensitive nociceptors in the naked molerat are functionally connected to SDH neurons as in mice however the same nociceptors are also functionally connected to deep dorsal horn neurons a connectivity that is rare in mice the pain biology of the naked molerat is unique among mammals thus the T0 of pain mechanisms in this unusual species can provide L1 insights into what constitutes normal rat nociception
LR,lateral rectus,TS-3470,this T0 was designed to provide anatomic data to help surgeons avoid damage to the ocular motor SN during intraorbital operations the microsurgical anatomy of the ocular motor nerves was studied in adult cadaveric heads orbits dissections were performed with a TSM the nerves were exposed and the neural and muscular relationships of each portion of the nerve were examined and measured the superior division of the oculomotor nerve coursed between the optic nerve and the SR muscle after it left the annular tendon and its branches entered into the SR muscle and levator muscle a mean of five fibers range innervated the superior rectus muscle and a mean of one fiber range followed a medial direction or went straight through the superior rectus muscle the VPI division of the oculomotor nerve branched into the medial rectus VPI rectus and IO muscles the trochlear nerve ended on the orbital side of the posterior onethird of the superior oblique muscle in specimens the abducens nerve ended on the posterior onethird of the lateral rectus muscle in specimens if the belly of the LR muscle was divided into three superiorinferior parts the nerve commonly entered into the middle onethird in specimens based on the body image thus distinguishing poorly between topdown effects of emotionsattitudes towards the body and disturbances due to proprioceptive disordersdistorted body schema disorders of body representation also emerge following damage to the right parietal lobe the possibility that parietal dysfunction might contribute to an is suspected based on the demonstrated association of spatial impairments comparable to those found T3 parietal lesion with this syndrome
PG,pyoderma gangrenosum,TS-3471,many advances in dermatology have been made in recent years in the present review article newly described disorders from the last six years are presented in detail we divided these reports into different sections including syndromes autoinflammatory diseases tumors and unclassified disease syndromes included are circumferential skin creases kunze type and unusual type of PC or a new syndrome autoinflammatory diseases include chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature candle syndrome pyoderma gangrenosum acne and hidradenitis suppurativa pash syndrome and pyogenic ICA PG acne and HS papash syndrome tumors include acquired reactive digital fibroma onychocytic matricoma and onychocytic carcinoma infundibulocystic nail bed squamous cell carcinoma and acral histiocytic nodules unclassified disorders include saurian papulosis symmetrical acrokeratoderma confettilike macular atrophy and skin spicules erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans
CM,complete hydatidiform mole,TS-3472,the estimated incidence of twin pregnancy consisting of hydatidiform mole and a coexisting fetus is per pregnancies since nine patients with this entity have been treated at the new england trophoblastic disease center netdc boston one patient had a partial hydatidiform mole coexisting with a normal placenta and fetus the other eight patients had twin pregnancies with a CM chm and coexisting fetus we compared the clinical outcomes in these patients and additional published case reports of multiple gestations composed of chm and coexisting fetuses with a group of patients with singleton chm treated at netdc twelve of the patients with chm and coexisting fetuses developed persistent gestational trophoblastic RT requiring chemotherapy five of these patients developed metastases requiring multiple cycles of chemotherapy to achieve remission the presenting symptoms of multiple conception with chm and coexisting fetuses were similar to those in patients with a singleton conception and CM however as compared to singleton chm patients having a multiple conception with chm and coexisting fetuses were diagnosed at a later gestational age had higher preevacuation betahuman chorionic gonadotropin C2 and had a greater propensity to develop persistent tumor these data indicate that patients with multiple conceptions consisting of chm and coexisting fetuses are at high risk of developing persistent gestational trophoblastic RT
IF,immunofixation,TS-3473,three patients two with typical primary sjÃ¶grens syndrome ss and the third with several features of ss including abnormal sialography and reduced tear secretion developed b cell nonhodgkins lymphoma nhl of parotid or lung or both isoelectric focusing of concentrated urine specimens in agarose followed by IF demonstrated the presence in each patients urine of monoclonal free light chains of the same class as that shown on the tumour cells in one patient the level of urinary free light chains was monitored and found to correlate with disease activity similar techniques showed no monoclonal light chains in the urine from a further cases of ss with no clinical evidence of lymphoma the detecn as part of transposon tn by using the nontransposable gene on r with tn on a separate plasmid we observed the genesis of a complex transposon with a structure similar to that of tn this finding confirms our previous hypothesis that tn has evolved directly from tn through acquisition of the oxa betalactamase gene by substitution of dna segments furthermore the mechanism of mobilization of pacyc derivatives by recadependent rat recombination was demonstrated
CS,cigarette smoking,TS-3474,alcohol use physical activity diet and CS are modifiable cardiovascular risk AF that have a substantial impact on the risk of myocardial infarction stroke and cardiovascular death we hypothesized that these behaviors may alter concentrations of cardiac troponin a marker of myocyte injury and btype natriuretic peptide a marker of myocyte stress both markers have shown strong association with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women with no evidence of cardiovascular disease we measured circulating concentrations of cardiac troponin t using a highsensitivity assay hstnt and the nterminal fragment of BNP ntprobnp we used logistic regression to determine if these behaviors were associated with hstnt â\x89¥ ngl or with ntprobnp in the highest quartile â\x89¥ ngl the median q to q ntprobnp of the cohort was ngl to ngl and of of the cohort had circulating hstnt â\x89¥ ngl in adjusted models women who drank to drinksweek had lower odds of having a hstnt â\x89¥ ngl odds ratio confidence interval to and lower odds of having an elevated ntprobnp odds ratio confidence interval to we were subsequently able to validate the results for btype natriuretic peptide in a large independent cohort in conclusion our results suggest that regular alcohol consumption is associated with lower concentrations of hstnt and ntprobnp cardiovascular biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk and raise the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of alcohol consumption may be mediated by direct effects on the myocardium
DCI,decompression illness,TS-3475,as the use of oxygen enhances the resorption of gas bubbles in DCI it is recommended and generally accepted that the inspired oxygen concentration in emergency treatment of diving accidents has to be as close to as possible therefore several emergency oxygen devices are offered to the diving community but only with little data in literature on the tau of these devices we tested four emergency oxygen devices with respect to efficacy of oxygen supply and breathing comfort at rest nine blinded volunteers had to breathe from the four systems with face mask and mouthpiece as well gases were measured with mass spectrometry during a min interval from a capillary port close to the subject the results showed that none of the systems was able to deliver oxygen all the time but in three systems inspiratory oxygen values were achieved although in one system the nitrogen washout was slowed due to air contamination during inspiration the fourth tested system frequently supplied the subjects simply with air while PLB at rest we conclude from our T0 that it is difficult to achieve oxygen levels close to in practice even in a perfectly working system the interface between device and subject is a source of entrained air especially when oxygen PLB has to be performed over a longer period of time in addition two of four systems had conceptional problems to supply the subjects with pure o during inspiration none of the tested systems was perfectly designed to serve in such emergencies
CM,carboxymethyl,TS-3476,in this T0 three chemically CM polysaccharides cmcps were derived from cyclocarya paliurus PSs the physicochemical properties and antioxidant activity in vitro of carboxymethyl derivatives were determined the results of degree of substitution and ftir analysis showed the carboxymethylation of polysaccharides were successful compared with unmodified PSs the contents of carbohydrate and protein were decreased while cmcp with highest ds value had more uronic acid the CM derivatives was mainly composed of ara gal glc man gala with a molecular weight mw of Ã\x97 da compared with the native polysaccharide the cmcp with highest ds and mw exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in Î²carotenelinoleic acid CA however the superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity were decreased by cmcps these results demonstrated AGA carboxymethylation modification could enhance the potential of c paliurus polysaccharide as oxidation inhibitor
RN,radionuclide,TS-3477,a case of osteoid osteoma in an unusual location is reported the osteoma was diagnosed and the nidus was localized to the anterior colliculus of the medial malleolus based on the clinical symptoms and on the findings in RN bone scanning tomography and CT ct scanning after precise radiographic localization of the nidus it was determined that the lesion could be excised surgically without compromising the ankle joint the RT was removed by en block excision and curettage at months followup the patient was free of pain without impairment of function
LT,lissauers tract,TS-3478,microsurgical drezotomy mdt consists of an incision and bipolar coagulations performed ventrolaterally in the dorsal REZ drez at the entrance of the rootlets into the dorsolateral sulcus the lesion is directed at ventromedially and to mm deep according to the preoperative neurological status and the desired effects mdt i interrupts the small nociceptive MF regrouped laterally and the large myotatic afferents which runs centrally whilst sparing part of the C1 medial lemniscal fibres ii destroys the excitatory medial part of the LT iii and the cells of the dorsalmost layers of the DH which can be the site of hyperactivity as we were able to record in patients with deafferentation pain best indications are i welllocalized CA pain such as pancoast syndrome ii neuropathic pain due to brachial plexus injuries cauda equina andor spinal cord lesions especially for pain corresponding to segmental lesions peripheral nerve injuries amputation herpes zoster especially when the predominant component of pain is of the paroxysmal type andor corresponds to provoked hyperalgesiaallodynia iii excess of spasticity especially when associated with severe pain
PD,disease progression,TS-3479,the purpose of this study was to examine two theories of hiv disclosure the first is a PD theory and the second is the theory of competing consequences participants were hivpositive gay men involved in a larger study of hiv disclosure SEM was used to analyze each MM with the root mean square error of approximation rmsea and the nonnormed fit index nnfi used to evaluate goodness of fit the rmsea for the PD model was and the nnfi was the rmsea for the consequences model was and nnfi was both indices are considered to be a close fit however the parameter estimates for disease progression to disclosure in the disease MM and PD to consequences in the consequences MM were nonsignificant suggesting that disease progression may not play a role in the decision to disclose an hiv diagnosis researchers may want to focus on the intentions and possible outcomes from disclosure as predictive AF
EMS,electrophoretic mobility shift,TS-3480,mammalian high mobility group hmgiy chromosomal proteins bind with high affinity to the minor groove of a trich sequences of dna both in vitro and in vivo EMS assays demonstrate that in vitro both native and recombinant human hmgi proteins also bind but with lower affinity to preferred regions on isolated avian nucleosome core particles containing approximately base pairs of random sequence dna up to four discrete hmgi core particle complexes can be detected by EMSA when increasing molar ratios of protein are associated with cores both proteindna and proteinprotein interactions are involved in hmgi binding to cores the interaction of hmgi with core dna is demonstrated by both thermal denaturation and dnase i footprinting experiments chemical crosslinking studies employing reversible photoactivatable crosslinkers combined with one and 2DE electrophoretic analyses indicate that in vitro hmgi binds to cores in close proximity to histones ha and hb and h in situ crosslinking of k human erythroleukemia cell nuclei demonstrate that native hmgiy binds in a similar manner to nucleosomal histones in vivo proteolytic removal of the positively charged aminoterminal tails of the octamer histones abolishes IB of hmgi to core particles however core IB is not mediated by the negatively charged carboxylterminal tail of the hmgi protein since an in vitro produced mutant protein lacking this region binds to core particles in a manner similar to fulllength hmgi together these results demonstrate that hmgi both in vitro and in vivo binds to preferred regions on the front face of core nucleosomes
AI,aortic insufficiency,TS-3481,until recently the cause of isolated AI ai was usually thought to be inflammatory or rheumatic in most cases however at our institution we have noted a high prevalence of myxomatous degeneration md in aortic valves removed for ai in this T0 we report anatomic observations on valves from consecutive patients with isolated ai undergoing aortic VR surgery fiftysix consecutive aortic valves removed at our institution from to for isolated ai andor aortic aneurysm were reviewed anatomic features were compared with clinical PH and echocardiographic data the anatomic results were also compared to agematched control aortic valves obtained at autopsy in cases a specific valvular cause of ai was determined infectious endocarditis seven cases chronic rheumatic disease four cases congenital bicuspid valve two cases of the remaining idiopathic cases had severe isolated md defined as expansion of the spongiosa and disruption of the fibrosa by the deposition of acid mucopolysaccharides in the absence of severe calcification fibrosis or other pathologic findings only aortic valves from the autopsy controls had severe md eighteen of the patients also had a clinical PH of aortic dilatationaneurysm of which were confirmed to be dilated by echocardiographic criteria of these five had md of the aortic valve only three had both md and cystic medial degeneration cmd of the aorta two had cmd of the aorta only and two had no TPS diagnosis isolated md of the aortic valve is the most common cause of isolated ai in our patient population furthermore in a subset of nonmarfans patients with both ai and dilatation of the aortic rootaortic aneurysm the incidence of md is even higher these results suggest that there is overlap between md and cmd in nonmarfans patients and that both entities may be part of a spectrum of a generalized connective tissue disorder
IC,ischemic cardiopathy,TS-3482,diabetes mellitus type ii a cause of preclinical left VVI dysfunction that can progress to cardiac insufficiency ventricular dysfunction in diabetic patients is attributed to SAH or IC diastolic VVI dysfunction takes place during the course of diabetes mellitus the purpose of the present article is to report on the influence of HG on the left ventricular diastolic dysfunction independently of dyslipidemia obesity and SAH usually present in diabetic patients left ventriculart the critical time is much shorter for embryonic tissues than for more developed tissues our results have implications for all research where embryonic tissues are harvested but not processed immediately
SF,surfactant,TS-3483,we study shearinduced gelation in a microchannel without adding any salt for a CP colloid that is fully SD under stagnant conditions the initial stability is achieved by negative charges from the CP chain end groups then sulfonate surfactants are added to the system the surfactant adsorption is characterized by coexistence of domains of gaseouslike noninteracting molecules g and condensed patches of interacting molecules k it is found that for a fixed substantially high shear rate of x s peclet numberx in the absence of surfactants the shearinduced gelation of the system does occur and when the surfactants are added as the surfactant surface coverage on the particles increases to a certain value the shearinduced gelation or even small extent of aggregation becomes impossible we have estimated the derjaguinlandauverweyoverbeek dlvo interaction energy barrier from the measured zetapotentials and found that in all the cases the corresponding shearinduced collision SE is orders of magnitude larger than the required SE to overcome the barrier thus one would expect occurrence of gelation for all the systems this clearly indicates presence of additional nondlvo interactions which under very low ionic strength are related to the adsorbed SF patches that generate strongly repulsive shortrange hydration force moreover when no gelation but only aggregation occurs after passing through the microchannel the cluster size distribution exhibits distinct bimodality the structure of the obtained gels also depends on the SF surface coverage
TD,tangier disease,TS-3484,TD td is a phenotypic expression of rare familial syndrome with mutations in the abca transporter the risk of coronary i.a. disease in patients with td is variable on the other hand the pivotal role of plateletactivating factor paf mediator in atheromatosis was found plasma lipoproteins are transporters of the AH pafah in cells and known as lipoproteinphospholipase a lppla in plasma and regulators of paf C2 in blood in addition paf can be biosynthesized from the CR and the de novo pathways in which lysoplatelet activating factoracetyltransferase lysopafat and platelet activating factorcholinephosphotransferase pafcpt are the regulatory enzymes the aim of this T0 is to investigate in a td patient with a unique mutation ca the concentration of paf in blood the equivalent concentration for aggregation ec values of platelet rich plasma prp toward paf adenosine diphosphate adp and thrombin and the MICs of paf metabolic enzymes lppla pafah lysopafat and pafcpt
OP,organophosphorus,TS-3485,T3 only six months a commercefree internetbased milksharing model is operating in nearly countries connecting mothers who are able to donate breast milk with the CGs of babies who need breast milk some public health authorities have condemned this initiative out of hand although women have always shared their milk in many settings infant formula has become the obvious alternative to a mothers own milk yet an internationally endorsed recommendation supports mothertomother milk sharing as the best option in place of a birth mothers milk why then this rejection several possibilities come to mind ignorance and prejudice surrounding shared BM a perceived challengtaraldehyde recombinant e coli was having high periplasmic expression of OP hydrolase enzyme which hydrolyzes the methyl parathion into two products pnitrophenol and dimethyl thiophosphoric acid cells immobilized spce was studied under sem cells immobilized spce was associated with CV and cyclic voltammograms were recorded before and T3 hydrolysis of methyl parathion detection was calibrated based on the relationship between the changes in the current observed at v potential because of redox SMB of the hydrolyzed product pnitrophenol as concentration of methyl parathion was increased the oxidation current also increased only Î¼l volume of the sample was required for analysis detection range of biosensor was calibrated between and Î¼m of methyl parathion from the linear range of calibration plot a single immobilized spce was reused for reactions with PR of of its initial enzyme activity
HP,highpass,TS-3486,the optimal bandwidth for recording the visual CEP vep to PR was investigated in normal subjects by reanalyzing offline data recorded on tape using an open bandwidth of hz khz power spectral analysis of the vep revealed little SE above hz with digital filtering the amplitude np was significantly att only when the lowpass filter was reduced to hz or when the HP filter was raised to hz with analogue filtering there was significant prolongation of latency of p when the lowpass filter dboctave was reduced to hz and a significant decrease in RL when the highpass filter dboctave exceeded hz however the effects of analogue filtering were not uniform across subjects in subjects the latency of p was prolonged using a lowpass filter of hz and in other subjects the RL was shortened when the hz HP filter was introduced if a restricted bandwidth is used nonuniform distortion of RL could make a significant contribution to the variability in RL of p the optimal bandwidth is one which minimises this contribution to the variability hz to greater than hz
SD,stable,TS-3487,this paper illustrates the validity of vertebroplasty vp in patients with primary benign or M1 lesion in the C2 spine from january to december ten consecutive patients were treated with vp for a total of ten vertebral HB two symptomatic vertebral haemangiomas at c and c multiple myeloma at c two cases and one case at c five patients with vertebral metastasis from breast or LC at c c three cases and c all the patients complained of pain resistant to continuous medical management all procedures were performed under general anaesthesia by AL RPA under ct or fluoroscopy control with manual dislocation of the carotid axis a transoral approach under fluoroscopy was performed to treat the c lesion bone biopsy was never performed vp was performed to prevent fracture after implantation of a double discal prothesis in two patients for patients with multiple myeloma vp was performed to prevent new vertebral fracture vp was performed before of radiotherapy in three patients with metastasis and just after radiotherapy in two two M1 patients were lost at one year followup due to death from systematic DWI results were evaluated on the visual analogue scale vas and the oswestry disability index ods a successful outcome was observed with a complete resolution or partial reduction of pain in of patients hours after vp at months followup we recorded a reduction of four points in the vas DUE and a reduction in the ods score no extravertebral vascular or discal cement leakage was observed at months xray followup showed a SD result percutaneous treatment with vp for benign or malignant cervical spine lesions is a valuable miniinvasive and quick method that allows a CR and enduring resolution of painful vertebral symptoms without fracture of the adjacent or distal vertebral HB
PA,pulmonary atresia,TS-3488,a twostage surgical procedure was performed in a young AD with PA and a VVI septal defect with upper lobe pulmonary i.a. flow from confluent central pulmonary arteries and lower lobe pulmonary blood flow originating from two C1 systemicpulmonary collaterals initially a dacron y graft was anastomosed between the ascending aorta and the collaterals and a graft to the LPA at the second T0 continuity was established between the right ventricle and the y graft by using a valved dacron conduit and the VVI septal defect was closed
PI,peripheral iridectomy,TS-3489,ectopia lentis continues to be a perplexing diagnostic and therapeutic problem for most ophthalmologists however thorough investigation both SVR and ocular can in most cases establish either an environmental etiology or the nature of the heritable disorder in cases with SVR disease and ectopia lentis the ophthalmologist should insure that each patient obtains adequate consultation with other specialists in order that proper prophylactic and therapeutic measures are available the marfan syndrome homocystinuria and the weillmarchesani together account for the majority of dislocated lenses each of these requires a somewhat different therapeutic approach glaucoma should be recognized as a frequent complication in each of these conditions but is most serious in the weillmarchesani syndrome in which it often occurs early in life and remains unrecognized until serious damage has occurred because of the pupillaryblock nature of the glaucoma in this condition a prophylactic PI must be seriously considered in every case while lens surgery should be undertaken if the glaucoma cannot be controlled by medical or surgical means in homocystinuria because of the potential V1 complications of GA the ophthalmologist is often in a dilemma the lens in this condition seems to be more mobile than in other ectopia lentis disorders and therefore likely to compromise vision earlier in life however due to the risk of vascular thrombosis lens surgery should be delayed whenever possible until the patient is old enough to tolerate local anesthesia likewise patients with the marfan syndrome should be handled conservatively and in general CF quite well simple with spectacle correction due to the VHF of immediate surgical complications it is advisable to avoid an opensky technique to lens removal using aspiration or a pars plana RPA instead
SPF,sphase cells,TS-3490,patients with suspected or proven acute myocardial infarction complicated by VAs not QTc by lidocaine therapy bolus dose mg followed by infusion mgmin were treated either with an increased dose of lidocaine bolus dose mg followed by infusion mgmin or with mg nnbis dimethylammonium chloride qx astra sweden as an iv infusion during min patients or min patients in the lidocaine group the arrhythmias were controlled in out of patients in the qz group in out of a difference that is not statistically significant however the frequency of sideeffects was significantly higher p less than in the qx group out of patients they were also more seroportion of SPF among the survivors exceeds the faction of sphase cells in UT populations this increase is consistent with a relative resistance of SPF to alkylating agents and nitrosoureas
IB,binding,TS-3491,phenolic marine NK product is a kind of new potential ARIs aris in order to investigate the IB mode and inhibition mechanism molecular docking and dynamics studies were performed to explore the interactions of six phenolic inhibitors with human aldose reductase halr considering physiological environment all the neutral and other two ionized states of each phenolic inhibitor were adopted in the simulation the calculations indicate that all the inhibitors are able to form SD hydrogen bonds with the halr active pocket which is mainly constructed by residues tyr his and trp and they impose the inhibition effect by occupying the AS space in all inhibitors only la and its two ionized derivatives laion and laion in which neither of the orthohydrogens of hydroxyl is substituted by br bind with halr AS residues using the terminal hydroxyl while all the other inhibitors at least one of whose orthosites of and hydroxyls are substituted by br substituent which take much electronwithdrawing effect and steric hindrance bind with halr through the lactone group this means that the br substituent can effectively regulate the IB modes of phenolic inhibitors although the lactone bound inhibitors have relatively high rmsd values our dynamics T0 shows that both IB modes are of high stability for each inhibitor molecule the ionization does not NC its original binding mode but it does gradually increase the binding free energy which reveals that besides hydrogen bonds the electrostatic effect is also important to the inhibitorhalr interaction
CD,crohns disease,TS-3492,our aim was to study the influence of psychotherapy in addition to a standardized corticosteroid treatment on the somatic and psychosocial course of CD
OF,oral fluid,TS-3493,the purpose of this review was to discuss the history of the OD and implementation of oral fluid diagnostics for infectious diseases of humans and domestic animals the use of OF for the assessment of health and diagnosis of disease in humans and animals has a surprisingly long PH as early as pollaci and ceraulo reported sensitive and specific agglutination of micrococcus melitensis brucella melitensis by oral fluid from patients diagnosed with malta fever a report of the detection of antibodies against HIV virus hiv in oral fluid from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids marked the start of a remarkably rapid series of developments in oral fluidbased assays cumulatively the literature strongly supports implementation of oral fluidbased diagnostics in veterinary diagnostic medicine pathogenspecific iga igm and igg antibodies have all been demonstrated in OF collected from diverse domestic animal species in response to infection a variety of infectious agents both local and SVR are shed in oral fluid including some of the most economically significant pathogens of production animals eg footandmouth disease virus CSF virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ultimately pointofcare rapid assays ie cowside sowside or penside tests and access to RT infectious disease data will revolutionize our delivery of health management services
PG,pyoderma gangrenosum,TS-3494,a yearold man presented with painful erythema with pustules and multiple small ulcers on the shins he had suffered from ulcerative colitis uc and received oral glucocorticosteroid and SASP therapies for years biopsy of the lesion demonstrated mixed cellular infiltrates with dominant neutrophils the patient was diagnosed with PG pg and underwent leukocytapheresis lcap an extracorporeal leucocyte removal therapy once a week for weeks without changing the doses of the oral medications the skin lesions as well as clinical signs of uc rapidly improved after lcap and no recurrence was seen during a followup period there were no major complications during lcap lcap will provide an effective and safe tool for the treatment of pg
BA,benzamide,TS-3495,we investigated the association between FLV and nausea from various viewpoints the incidence of nausea induced by fluvoxamine was plasma 5-HIAA acid phiaa C2 after FLV administration were significantly higher in patients with nausea ngml than in those without nausea ngml on the other hand no significant differences were found between patients with and patients without nausea in terms of sex age initial and maximum dosages of FLV and its PC and clinical response to fluvoxamine however the incidence of nausea in patients who were initially po fluvoxamine at under mgday was significantly lower than in those who were started at above mgday in addition mosapride a member of the BA family was effective in alleviating fluvoxamineinduced nausea these results suggest that fluvoxamineinduced nausea is associated with hyperactivity in serotonergic neurons
CA,cerebral atrophy,TS-3496,report on patients with multiple sclerosis who additionally to other examinations were subjected an examination by cranial computerized tomography the findings were unobtrusive in cases CBF atrophy was found in patients hypodensic regions in patients and both alterations simultaneously in patients one female patient with a recent episode at first showed a region with contrast enhancement which became later isodensic at the same time a CA developed CCT in patients with multiple sclerosis represents an enrichment of diagnostic possibilities
RG,reference group,TS-3497,the purpose of the present T0 was to investigate whether the metabolism of clomipramine is altered by chronic alcohol drinking eleven recently detoxified alcoholic patients were included experimental group eg and compared to a RG of patients with no history of alcoholism RG rg n blood concentrations of clomipramine and its metabolites were measured as part of the routine drug monitoring program clearances were estimated from trough concentrations according to a MM developed previously results indicate strong inhibition of demethylation clearance in group eg when compared to group rg median values and lh with significant increase of the clomipramine to desmethylclomipramine ratio median values and no difference was found for hydroxylation in addition high rho is observed between hydroxylation and demethylation Cl in group eg spearman rs but not in REF group rg rs followup data indicate that impairment of demethylation capacity can persist for several weeks or months T3 withdrawal from alcohol the interest of calculating clomipramine to desmethylclomipramine ratios during routine drug monitoring is emphasized values of or larger often being associated with MLD andor alcoholrelated problems
PG,pentagastrin,TS-3498,rat stomach sensitivity to PG was examined in fetal days and newborn dayold preparations in vivo and in vitro gastric acidification in vivo was expressed as the gastric content ph and in vitro as the net transepithelial h fluxes determined in an ussing chamber in both preparations fetal stomach first responded to pentagastrin on day dosedependent h secretion was demonstrated in vitro for PG concentrations of to m with halfmaximal stimulations at x and x m on days and respectively in contrast isolated fundic mucosa of dayold rat pups exhibited very low h secretion rates and pentagastrin did not significantly stimulate acid SO fetal SS IRG was detected as early as day in fairly constant concentrations about pg eq synthetic human gastrinml these results indicate that although IRG is present in SS as early as day PG does nt stimulate acid secretion until day when fetal stomach exhibits active h secretion and decreased passive permeability PG sensitivity disappears during the st days of extrauterine life these findings strongly suggest that the OD of PG sensitivity in rat stomach is biphasic
CA,catecholaminergic,TS-3499,lipopolisaccharide lps is a potent activator of the immune system but also activates the HPA hpa axis and cerebral catecholamine systems in the present T0 the effect of peripheral lps administration on catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in discrete brainstem nuclei was examined two hours following systemic administration of lps or microgramskg norepinephrine ne content in the locus coeruleous lc was significantly increased in a dose related manner an increased dopamine da turnover as reflected by the dihydroxyphenylacetic dopac homovanillic acid hvada ratio dopac hvada was also observed at the lc with the medium and high doses of lps administered endotoxin caused the main effects in the nucleus of the tractus solitarii nts in which a it was found ne content increased in a dose related fashion b da turnover index was elevated with and microgramskg lps doses and c levels of serotonin ht and its catabolite hydroxyindoleacetic acid hiaa were also significantly elevated following the i.t. of or microgramskg lps by contrast a consistent lack of CA and serotonergic responses to endotoxin treatment was observed at the level of midbrain raphe nuclei mrn these results demonstrate that differential neurochemical changes may occur in the brainstem region with a rank order of activation by lps that was nts lc mrn suggesting different neural ATP for central effects of peripheral immune activation
IP,interpositus nucleus,TS-3500,spinocerebellar fibers originate from neurons in the medial part of lamina vii including stillings S3 nucleus the lateral part of lamina v and the ventrolateral part of the ventral horn in the lowest lumbar l and sacralcaudal segments by using the anterograde transport of biotinylated dextran in the rat this T0 examined whether these spinocerebellar SF project to the cerebellar nuclei anterogradely labeled axons that originated from the lcaudal segments ascended contralaterally through the SF layer of the lateral cord and entered the cerebellum through the superior cerebellar peduncle and the restiform body labeled terminals were bilaterally seen in the medial nucleus and the anterior and posterior IP they were most numerous contralaterally in the anterior IP in the anterior interpositus nucleus they were distributed mainly in the most VP part at rostral C2 and in small numbers in the medial part in the medial nucleus labeled terminals were seen in limited rostromedial parts of the middle and the caudomedial subdivision only a small number of labeled terminals were seen in the caudomedial part of the posterior interpositus nucleus the present study shows that the spinocerebellar fibers originating from the lowest lumbar and sacralcaudal segments project to TPS areas of the anterior interpositus and the medial nucleus this finding suggests that the SN of origin convey information from muscles joints and integument to the cerebellar SC and nuclei in relation to movement of the hindlimbs
RB,rebreathing,TS-3501,BB activity has been shown to be influenced by respiratory behavior here we evaluated whether respirationinduced hypo or hypercapnia may support differentiation between physiological versus pathological respiratory SMB in particular we investigated whether systemic physiological measures could predict the brains TF hemodynamics T3 three respiratory challenges ie breathholding RB and HV compared to restingstate prefrontal hemodynamics were assessed in healthy subjects n using PET IR spectroscopy fnirs SVR physiological measures were assessed in form of HR rate partial endtidal carbon dioxide QO2 rate and saturation of IP oxygen TF dynamics were quantified using the WT coherence ie defined here as corticalsystemic coherence we found that the three respiratory challenges modulated corticalsystemic coherence differently T3 rebreathing corticalsystemic coherence could be predicted from the amplitude of the HR rate strong negative rho after breathholding the same observation was made moderate negative correlation after hyperventilation no significant effect was observed these effects were found only in the frequency range of very lowfrequency oscillations the presented findings highlight a distinct role of RB in predicting corticalsystemic coupling based on heart rate changes which may represents a measure of affective states in the brain the applied multimodal assessment of hemodynamic and SVR physiological measures during respiratory challenges may therefore have potential applications in the differentiation between physiological and pathological respiratory SMB
CP,cerebellopontine,TS-3502,the retrolabyrinthine RPA was described several years ago however its use was restricted to functional surgery of the CP angle its detractors reproach its narrowness but a large approach to the cerbellopontine angle can be performed after an extended SE of the posterior and middle fossa dura and section of the endolymphatic sac this RPA was used in cases of acoustic neurinomas stage i and ii with normal hearing hearing preservation was obtained in cases we had deafness in cases who had extensive tumor in the bottom of the internal AEP canal
PP,pulsatile perfusion,TS-3503,aortic histamineforming capacity hfc has been examined in relationship to the applied mean shear stress intensity created by PP of rabbit aortas with plateletfree blood for a h period mean shear stress intensities ranged from to dyncm results indicate that a high correlation exists between the shear AS and the hfc which is described by the regression equation y x where y hfc and x mean shear AS intensity results suggest that the rate of histamine formation is CS to the applied shear stress and that the histidine decarboxylase system of the aorta may have the potential of serving as one coupling agent between applied hemodynamic stress and resultant alterations in aortic wall resistance to macromolecules
AS,atherosclerotic,TS-3504,placental growth factor pigf mediates angiogenesis and inflammation and is upregulated in early and T3 AS lesions but its effects on the function of V1 endothelial cells is still largely unknown this T0 was designed to test the effects of pigf on the secretion of Th1 cytochemokines in vascular EC cells
RF,radiofrequency,TS-3505,the authors retrospectively evaluated the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous RF ablation of lung tumors close to the HR the third system consisted of a collagen membrane seeded with respiratory epithelial cells and human chondrocytes onto different sides of the membrane which achieved the most promising results in combination with an ALI system and fibroblastconditioned medium an D2 epithelial multilayer with differentiated epithelial cells could be generated our results suggest that at least three factors are necessary for the OD towards a tracheal replacement a BL equivalent consisting of collagen fibers for cellcell interaction and cell polarization extracellular factors of mesenchymal fibroblasts and the presence of an ALI system for proliferation and differentiation of the epithelial cells
MS,medial septal,TS-3506,ACh denervation of the hippocampus by MS ms lesions results in the ingrowth of IP sympathetic SF originating from the SCG into the hippocampus to determine the effect of hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth hsi hqnb lquinuclidinyl benzilicn IB was assessed in the dorsal and VP hippocampus four weeks after ms lesions in dorsal hippocampus hsi was found to significantly increase the number bmax of hqnb IB sites and to normalize the decrease in affinity found in animals with ms lesions plus ganglionectomy ie no ingrowth in ventral hippocampus hsi was found to normalize the increased number of binding CS and decreased affinity found in animals with ms lesions without ingrowth no effect on either kd or bmax was found in animals that had undergone ganglionectomy with sham ms lesions these results suggest that hsi can induce changes in hippocampal muscarinic cholinergic receptors
AD,androgen deprivation,TS-3507,androgens are the primary regulators of epididymal structure and functions principal cells are the L1 cell type of the tissue and are particularly sensitive to androgen removal to distinguish the direct effects of androgens on this cell type dna microarrays were used to identify androgenregulated genes in the mouse proximal caput epididymidis pc cell L1 pc cells display tissue and caputspecific gene expression we examined changes in mRNA occurring and d after AD and d after androgen supplementation T3 being deprived of androgen for or d changes in transcript C2 were investigated for mediators of androgen action selected genes were analyzed by realtime rtpcr and changes at the protein levels were examined four distinct patterns of gene expression were G1 T3 androgen withdrawal the vast majority of genes displayed an early or late transient increase in expression C2 a differential ability of rescue was seen among androgenregulated genes depending on time of androgen supplementation many of the genes that were rescued at d were functionally linked by direct interactions and converged on igfi the ability for rescue T3 d of AD was severely compromised in many genes belonging to TPS PET gene families cell adhesion cell growth apoptosis and Tc and may be mediated in part by changes in androgen receptor coregulator expression these results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of androgen regulation in EPI principal cells
PCC,patientcentered care,TS-3508,the purpose of this scoping review was to describe how three tenants of PCC provision communication partnership and health promotion are addressed in patientcentered care modelsframeworks across the literature
PT,physiotherapy,TS-3509,outbreaks of communityacquired pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis have recently been described in association with health spa whirlpools in february we detected an outbreak of pseudomonas folliculitis among hospital staff and patients using a swimming pool in a newly constructed PT unit a rash developed in of the physiotherapists who had used the pool as compared with of the who had not p less than pseudomonas folliculitis also developed in of outpatients and of inpatients who had used the facility pseudomonas infection of a surgical wound also developed in of the inpatients the epidemic curve was consistent with a continuing commonsource outbreak p aeruginosa serotype o was isolated from three physiotherapists the patient with an INF surgical wound and the pool a casecontrol T0 of pool users did not identify risk factors for infection although the physiotherapists had spent longer in the pool than had the patients after hyperchlorination and structural repairs to the pool no further cases were identified among pool users this outbreak is the first reported nosocomial outbreak of pseudomonas folliculitis further investigation is needed to determine the risk of serious pseudomonas infections in hospitalized patients using PT pools
SAC,spindle assembly checkpoint,TS-3510,CA cells contain an abnormal number of chromosomes aneuploidy which is a prevalent form of genetic instability in human cancers abnormal amplification of centrosomes and defects of SAC are the L1 causes of CIN in cancer cells here we present PSA evidence to suggest a role of ecrg a novel tumor suppressor gene in maintaining chromosome stability ecrg localized to centrosomes during interphase and kinetochores during mitosis further analysis revealed that ecrg participates in centrosome amplification in a pdependent manner depletion of ecrg not only destabilized p downregulated p and increased the cyclin ecdk activity thus initiating centrosome amplification but also abolished the ability of p localize to centrosomes overexpression of ecrg restored the pdependent suppression of centrosome duplication furthermore ecrgdepleted cells show severely disrupted spindle phenotype but fail to maintain the MI arrest due to minimal bubr protein levels taken together our results indicate that ecrg is important for ensuring centrosome duplication SAC and accurate chromosome segregation and its SD may contribute to CIN and aneuploidy in human cancers
HM,malignancies,TS-3511,amplification and overexpression of erbb herneu protooncogene has been linked to human HM including PT of the breast ovary and stomach it has been implicated in tumor growth sensitivity to standard chemotherapy prognosis of patients and diseasefree survival although the clinical use of trastuzumab herceptin has prolonged the survival of breast cancer patients with erbboverexpressing PT there is an urgent need for more potent and orally bioavailable smallmolecule inhibitors cp is a potent inhibitor of erbb receptor autophosphorylation in IN cells and is currently undergoing phase i clinical trials here we describe the effects of cp in vitro and in vivo in human breast cancer models cp is selective for inhibiting growth of herdriven cell lines in addition we show that it induces g cell cycle block in erbboverexpressing bt human breast carcinoma cells and inhibits erbb autophosphorylation in xenografts when po po to athymic mice it induces a marked reduction of extracellular signalregulated kinase and akt phosphorylation RT cell apoptosis and PR of caspase po administration qd or bid of cp inhibits the growth of erbboverexpressing tumors in athymic mice without overt adverse effects
DF,developed force,TS-3512,for the rapid simultaneous determination of MSG msg benzoic acid ba and sorbic acid sa in canned food and other processed food samples we developed a method that combines incapillary derivatization with separation by capillary PACE this method employs the rapid derivatization of msg with ophthalaldehyde opa in the presence of mercaptopropionic acid mpa and enables the PCD of the resulting opamsg derivative and of nonderivatized ba and sa at nm the composition of the BG electrolyte aal mechanics investigating the rosmediated effects DF of isolated rat PTC muscles was depressed with a concentration and timedependency by fe Î¼m the contractile response to ca was reduced but it was partially reversed by coincubation with catalase and dmso but not tempol in agreement in situ PCD of oh was increased by fe whereas o was unchanged the myosinatpase activity was significantly decreased contractions dependent on the sarcolemal ca influx were impaired only by fe Î¼m and antioxidants had no effect in skinned SF fe reduced the pcaforce relationship and pca was rightshifted by in conclusion iron overload can acutely impair myocardial contractility by reducing myosinatpase activity and myofibrillar ca sensitivity these effects are mediated by local production of oh and ho nevertheless in a such high concentration as Î¼m fe appears to depress force also by reducing ca influx probably due to a competition at ICa
SA,streptavidin,TS-3513,the thermodynamic and structural cooperativity between the ser and dbiotin hydrogen bonds was measured by calorimetric and xray crystallographic studies of the sada double mutant of SA the double mutant exhibits a binding affinity approximately x times lower than that of wildtype SA at degrees c the corresponding reduction in binding free SE deltadeltag of kcalmol was nearly completely due to IB enthalpy losses at this temperature the loss of IB affinity is fold greater than that predicted by a linear combination of the singlemutant energetic perturbations kcalmol indicating that these two mutations interact cooperatively crystallographic characterization of the double mutant and comparison with the two single mutant structures suggest that structural rearrangements at the s position when the d carboxylate is removed mask the true energetic contribution of the dbiotin interaction taken together the thermodynamic and structural analyses support the conclusion that the wildtype hydrogen bond between dod and biotinn is thermodynamically stronger than that between sog and biotinn
EP,equilibrium point,TS-3514,to elucidate the roles of sarcoplasmic reticulum sr ca cycling and NCE ncx in SAN node san pacemaking we have applied stability and bifurcation analyses to a coupledclock system MM developed by maltsev and lakatta am j physiol HR circ physiol hh EP ep at which the system is stationary ie the oscillatory system fails to function periodic orbit limit cycle and their stability were determined as functions of model parameters the stability analysis to detect bifurcation points confirmed crucial importance of sr ca pumping rate constant pup ncx density kncx and ltype ca channel conductance for the system function reported in previous parameterdependent numerical simulations we showed however that the model cell does not exhibit selfsustained automaticity of sr ca release at any clamped voltage and therefore needs further tuning to reproduce oscillatory local ca release and net membrane current reported experimentally at mv our further D2 bifurcation analyses revealed important novel features of the pacemaker system that go beyond prior numerical simulations in relation to the roles of sr ca cycling and ncx in san pacemaking specifically we found that ncx contributes to ep instability and enhancement of robustness in the full system during normal spontaneous action potential firings while stabilizing eps to prevent sustained ca oscillations under Vc clamping sr requires relatively large kncx and subsarcolemmal ca DWI barrier ie subspace to contribute to ep destabilization and enhancement of robustness and decrementing pup or kncx decreased the full system robustness against hyperpolarizing loads because ep stabilization and cessation of pacemaking were observed at the lower critical amplitude of hyperpolarizing bias currents suggesting that sr ca cycling contributes to enhancement of the full system robustness by modulating ncx currents and promoting ep destabilization
NS,negative symptoms,TS-3515,an exploratory T0 was conducted of the strategies that schizophrenia patients and their relatives employ to cope with NS coping strategies and their perceived tau were elicited in semistructured interviews conducted separately with patients and relatives coping responses were coded according to the following dimensions behavioralcognitive socialnonsocial and problem focusedemotion focused overall the number of coping strategies was related to perceived coping tau for both patients and relatives regardless of the type of strategy perceived coping tau tended to be highest for apathy intermediate for alogia anhedonia and inattention and lowest for blunting relatives with more knowledge about schizophrenia used more coping strategies and reported higher levels of coping tau patient rejection by relatives and distress either patient or relative tended to not be related to coping strategies the findings suggest that patients and relatives use a wide variety of strategies to cope with NS of schizophrenia future clinical work and research need to evaluate whether families may benefit from psychoeducational approaches to teaching them how to better manage negative PS
TM,timolol maleate,TS-3516,timolol maleateloaded chitosan cs NPs were prepared by desolvation method exp variables such as molecular weight of cs and amount of crosslinking agent were varied to study their effect on drug entrapment efficiency size and PR rates of NPs chemical stability of TM tm and crosslinking of cs were confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy DSC studies were performed on drugloaded NPs to investigate crystalline nature of the drug T3 entrapment results indicated amorphous dispersion of drug in the polymer matrix SEM microscopy revealed irregularly shaped particles mean particle size of nanoparticles ranged between and nm while zeta potential ranged between and mv entrapment efficiency of nanoparticles ranged between and invitro PR studies were performed in phosphate buffer saline of ph a slow release of tm up to h was observed a full factorial design was employed and secondorder regression models were used to study the response drug PR at h release data as analyzed by an empirical relationship suggested that drug PR deviated from the fickian trend
AA,allergic asthma,TS-3517,osteopontin opn is a cytokine that is upregulated in epithelial cells and macrophages in the lungs of mice during chronic allergen challenge and airway CR and also in lungs of patients with asthma however it remains unclear whether opn has an in vivo effect on lung remodeling in AA based on its ability to induce smooth muscle and FB proliferation and migration we hypothesize that opn regulates lung CR and also affects subsequent airway hyperresponsiveness ahr
SA,status asthmaticus,TS-3518,airway mucus from asthmatics is often unusually solid the death of a patient in SA allowed the collection of g of abnormal airway mucus at autopsy its chemical and PCS properties were studied to reveal differences from more normal airway mucus the gel plug taken from the airways could be dispersed in m guanidinium chloride but it took wk and ml of extractant to disperse g of exudate completely in contrast treatment with mm dithiothreitol which reduces disulfide bonds dispersed the gel within seconds mucins accounted for of the nondialyzable material in the gel while dna constituted and proteoglycans could not be detected the mucins were similar in architecture and GA composition to other respiratory mucins and were present at a high concentration approximately mgml the majority of mucins were of extreme size mean mr x and slow to dissolve but sequential SE experiments on the gel exudate demonstrated a proportion of mucins the most readily extracted which had a higher density gml a lower mr x and were markedly more acidic than the bulk of the mucins both L1 and minor mucin populations were extremely heterogeneous in mass distribution electron microscopy of the major mucin species demonstrated extensive networks of molecules many microns in length the L1 mucin species was distinctly less acidic than mucins previously described from either normal or diseased airways amino acid analysis of fractions across the charge distribution suggested the presence of at least two different mucin proteins occurring as distinct glycoforms
SL,stereolithographic,TS-3519,the aim of the present T0 was to assess the clinical relevance of the potential mechanical error intrinsic error caused by the cylinderburr gap in a single type SL surgical template in implant guided surgery implants were inserted in patients using templates the pre and postoperative computed tomography ct scans were matched allowing comparison of the planned implants with the placed ones considering only the angular deviation values the t test was used to determine the influence of the guide fixation and the arch of support on accuracy values the pearson rho coefficient was used to correlate angular deviation and BD the intrinsic error was mathematically evaluated t test results indicated that the use of fixing screws p and the upper arch support p resulted in better accuracy the pearson correlation coefficient indicated a significant linear correlation between angular deviations and BD p a mean intrinsic error of was mathematically determined considering only the angular deviation as it was not influenced by other variables the intrinsic error is a significant factor compared to all the variables that could potentially affect the accuracy of computeraided implant placement
DF,dietary fiber,TS-3520,a T0 was made of the effect of the activity and purity of enzymes in the assay of total DF aoac method and specific DF components RS fructan and betaglucan in the measurement of total dietary fiber content of resistant starch samples the concentration of alphaamylase is critical however variations in the level of amyloglucosidase have little effect contamination of amyloglucosidase S9 with cellulase can result in significant underestimation of dietary fiber values for samples containing betaglucan pure betaglucan and cellulase purified from aspergillus niger amyloglucosidase S9 were used to determine acceptable critical levels of contamination sucrose which interferes with the measurement of in and fructooligosaccharides in plant materials and food products must be removed by hydrolysis of the sucrose to gl and fructose with a specific enzyme sucrase followed by borohydride reduction of the free sugars unlike invertase sucrase has no action on low degree of polymerization dp FOS such as kestose or kestotetraose fructan is hydrolyzed to fructose and gl by the combined action of HP exo and endoinulinases and these sugars are measured by the phydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide reducing sugar method specific measurement of betaglucan in cereal flour and food extracthe presence of at least one py motif in the enac complex and on ww domains and in nedd thus these results suggest that the novel suppressor protein nedd is the regulator of enac and hence a potential susceptibility gene for arterial hypertension
CN,cerebellar nuclei,TS-3521,acetylcholine content of different rat brain regions was measured a rho between acetylcholine content and ChAT chac activity in discrete brain regions was found however there are regions such as CN cerebellar hemisphere caudal medial forebrain bundle zone incerta nucleus vestibularis lateralis where the acetylcholine content is relatively much higher than the chac activity and regions such as ncochleares nmotor nv nmotor nvii nmotor nxii where chac activity was high and the content of acetylcholine is relatively low
EC,ethyl cellulose,TS-3522,liposomes are colloidal structures formed by the selfassembly of lipid molecules in solution into spherical selfclosed structures through their amphiphilic properties all liposome preparation protocols reported consist of several steps of preparation homogenization and purification which are laborintensive arduous and lengthy to execute in this work a new procedure has been developed to reduce the time of the postrehydration sizing of liposomes us proper control of the processing variables involved in this modified multiple emulsion technology could allow ERP incorporation of slightly water soluble drugs into EC microspheres without affecting drug stability
IM,inner medulla,TS-3523,salt and water PR is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome ns in this T0 we test for changes in the abundance of urea transporters aquaporin aqp nakcl cotransporter nkcc and nacl cotransporter ncc in nonpairfed and pairfed nephrotic animals doxorubicininjected male SDRs n were followed in metabolism cages urinary excretion of protein sodium and urea was measured periodically kidney IM im OM and SC tissue samples were dissected and analyzed for mrna and protein abundances at wk all doxorubicintreated rats developed features of ns with a ninefold increase in urine protein excretion from Â± to Â± mgday p and reduced urinary sodium excretion from to meqday p urine osmolalities were reduced in the nephrotic animals Â± treatment vs Â± control unlike animals fed AL uta protein abundance was unchanged in nephrotic pairfed rats glycosylated aqp was reduced in the im base of both nephrotic groups abundances of nkcc and ncc were consistently reduced Â± and Â± respectively in both nephrotic pairfed animals and animals fed AL in pairfed nephrotic rats we observed an increase in the cleaved form of membranebound Î³epithelial sodium channel enac however Î± and Î²enac subunits were unaltered nkcc and aqp mrna C2 were similar in treated vs control rats we conclude that dietary protein intake affects the response of medullary transport proteins to ns
PP,postprandial,TS-3524,the polypeptide ghrelin is an endogenous ligand at the growth hormone secretagogue receptor a to ghrelin multiple functions have been ascribed including promotion of gastrointestinal motility PP ghrelin C2 have been reported to be reduced in patients suffering from parkinson disease pd exp studies revealed neuroprotective effects of ghrelin in different pd models the purpose of the present study was i to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective action of ghrelin and ii to determine whether these effects occur with both the acylated and the unacylated form the T0 was conducted in primary mesencephalic cultures treated with mitochondrial complex i and complex ii inhibitors we show that protective effects of ghrelin against complex i inhibition with mpp
OA,phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid,TS-3525,soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of PT consisting of numerous histiotypes that all share a putative common mesenchymal origin although prognosis of these PT is determined by client of resting BAE cells with campelevating agents inhibited prostacyclin production and cyclooxygenase activity without affecting AA PR no change was detected in cyclooxygenase protein expression the TPS inhibitor of protein kinase a rpcamps adenosine cyclic monophosphorothioate rpisomer triethylammonium salt and the OA both suppressed campinduced inhibition suggesting that this inhibition is mediated by a phosphorylationdephosphorylation cascade which is possibly protein kinase adependent in lipopolysaccharidetreated cyclooxygenase expressing BAE cells where cyclooxygenase activity was selectively inhibited dibutyryl camp failed to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity cyclooxygenase protein was induced upon treatment with dibutyryl camp and further induction of cyclooxygenase protein was effected by ibmx isobutylmethylxanthine and dibutyryl camp in bacterial lipopolysaccharidestimulated cells these results suggest that increased cellular camp selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase activity without altering cyclooxygenase protein expression and at the same time upregulates cyclooxygenase protein this complex regulation of cyclooxygenase activity and protein expression by camp may represent a prostacyclininduced autoregulatory mechanism in BAE cells
GA,gallic acid,TS-3526,low molecular weight phenols of tannat red wines produced by traditional maceration tm prefermentative cold maceration pcm maceration enzyme enz and grapeseed tannins additions st were performed and discussed alternatives to tm increased wine phenolic contents but unequally st increased mainly smaller flavansol pcm anthocyanins and enz proanthocyanidins up to mgl however low molecular weight flavanols remained below mgl in all wines showing that there is not necessarily a correspondence between wine richness in total tannins and flavanols contents at low molecular weight pcm wines had particularly high concentrations of tyrosol and tryptophol yeast metabolism derived compounds the use of grapeseed enological tannins did not increase grape seed derived phenolic EDC such as GA caftaric acid was found in concentrations much higher than those reported in other grape varieties wine phenolic content and composition was considerably affected by the winemaking procedures tested
TE,thromboembolism,TS-3527,antineoplastic agentinduced pulmonary toxicity is an important cause of respiratory failure although the incidence of antineoplastic agentinduced pulmonary toxicity seems to be low more cases can be expected with increasing numbers of patients receiving the new generations of antineoplastic agents antineoplastic agents have previously been associated with bronchospasm HSRs venous TE and PH physicians should be aware of the clinical and radiographic presentations of the pulmonary toxicities associated with the newer antineoplastic agents the RPA to diagnosis risk AF and possible mechanisms of antineoplastic agentinduced pulmonary toxicity are discussed in this article
SD,semantic dementia,TS-3528,frontotemporal lobar degeneration ftld is a diagnostic term that encompasses three distinctly different syndromes united by historic as well as pathologic commonalities we briefly review the origins of the current classification scheme for diagnosing the three major subtypesfrontotemporal dementia SD and PPA highlighting the differences between subtypes as well as from alzheimers disease ad we briefly examine current understanding regarding the histopathology and genetics of ftld but note that there is a poor correspondence of these features with TPS subtypes of ftld for clinicians and clinical researchers this implicates the need for other diagnostic strategies neuropsychological and neurobehavioral testing currently offers the most sensitive and specific method for identifying subtypes and discriminating ftld from other forms of dementia multiple studies from the relevant literature are reviewed highlighting those findings that are likely to be most valuable to physicians finally we analyze some of the major findings from the C1 body of work on neuroimaging of ftld again focusing on those studies that potentially help discriminate ftld subtypes or assist with the discrimination of ftld from ad
EM,ethylmorphine,TS-3529,a study of the CL ndemethylase activity in rats treated with different dosage schedule of morphine or with a single dose of haloperidol was carried out it was found that prolonged administration of morphine to rats inhibited the rate of EM demethylation in vitro and diminished the liver cytochrome p level therefore it could be assumed that the changes in ndemethylase activity did not play a substantial role in altering of morphine pharmacokinetics haloperidol when given to rats did not NC the microsomal ndemethylase activity in vitro however when introduced into incubation mixture it inhibited theserved
TF,tibiofemoral,TS-3530,the pyrimidopurinone adduct mg deoxybetaderythropentofuranosylpyrimidoapurinhone formed in dna upon SE to MDA or base propenals was incorporated into datcgcmcggcatgdcatgccgcgat where m mg this duplex contained a twonucleotide bulge in the modified strand and was named the mgbd oligodeoxynucleotide it provided a MM for bp strand slippage deletions associated with the cpgiterated repeat hotspot for frameshift mutations from the salmonella typhimurium hisd gene mg was chemically stable in the mgbd duplex at neutral ph the twobase bulge in the mgbd oligodeoxynucleotide was localized and consisted of mg and the neighbor deoxycytosine the intrahelical orientation of mg was established from a combination of noe and chemical shift data mg was in the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond the neighbor deoxycytosine appeared to be extruded toward the major groove in contrast when mg was placed into the corresponding fully cDNA cpgiterated repeat duplex at neutral ph spontaneous and quantitative ringopening to noxopropenyldg the opg adduct was facilitated mao h reddy g r marnett l j and stone m p biochemistry the structure of the mgbd duplex suggested that the bulged CS lacked a cytosine amino group properly positioned to facilitate opening of mg and supports the notion that proper positioning of deoxycytn patients with primary osteoarthritis and varus or neutral TF alignment the posterior condylar angle was calculated intraoperatively and averaged degrees range degrees degrees eighteen knees had a posterior condylar angle value less than degrees whereas knees had a posterior condylar angle value of degrees or greater final rotational alignment of the FA component was set parallel to the transepicondylar axis only one of these knees required a lateral retinacular PR for proper patellar tracking during the knee arthroplasty when compared with three previously defined angles measured on the radiographs taken preoperatively only the tibial plateautibial shaft angle values were correlated significantly with the value of the posterior condylar angle as the tibial varus joint line obliquity increased there was a distinct tendency for the transepicondylar axis to be rotated more externally relative to the posterior condylar axis this variance suggests that the use of the posterior condylar axis as a rotational REF is inappropriate in many knees with arthritis with varus or neutral TF alignment in particular varus tibial joint line obliquity of more than degrees increases the likelihood of FA component malrotation when the posterior FA condyles are used to REF FA component rotation
CMI,chronic mesenteric ischemia,TS-3531,CMI cmi is a challenging clinical problem that is difficult to diagnose noninvasively diagnosis early in the disease process would enable lifesaving early surgical intervention previous studies established that superconducting quantum interference device squid magnetometers detect the slow wave changes in the magnetoenterogram meng noninvasively following induction of MES ischemia in animal models the purpose of this study was to assess functional physiological changes in the intestinal slow wave meng of patients with chronic MES ischemia pre and postoperative studies were conducted on cmi patients using meng and intraoperative recordings using invasive serosal electromyograms emg our preoperative meng recordings showed that patients with cmi exhibited a significant decrease in intestinal slow wave frequency from Â± cpm preprandial to Â± cpm PP p that was not observed in postoperative recordings Â± cpm preprandial and Â± cpm postprandial p intraoperative recording detected multiple frequencies from the ICM portion of jejunum before revascularization whereas normal serosal intestinal slow wave frequencies were observed T3 revascularization the preoperative meng data also showed signals with multiple frequencies suggestive of uncoupling and intestinal ischemia similar to intraoperative serosal emg our results showed that multichannel meng can identify intestinal slow wave dysrhythmias in cmi patients
BF,blister fluid,TS-3532,complement AF cc c factor b cd and the immunoglobulin iga were determined in suction BF of patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria and in NCs the C2 increased when the skin of the patients had been previously irradiated with WG CS but with kromayer radiation and were interpreted as being the result of increased vasopermeability
HR,hybrid resistance,TS-3533,allogeneic lymphocyte cytotoxicity alc is characterized by the rapid destruction of intravenously injected allogeneic lymphocytes by unsensitized hosts while alc has been reported in several mammalian species it has been most extensively studied in rats all the available in vivo and in vitro evidence points to nk cells as the effectors of alc the experiments described in this communication show that when donor and host share common alc determinants the extent to which allogeneic lymphocytes are killed is greatly reduced and sometimes even abolished relative to the killing that would have occurred in the absence of shared determinants thus allogeneic lymphocyte transfers in inbred rat strain combinations having the general pattern ab are associated with significantly higher levels of alc than are the corresponding a x bfb aa x bf or c x afc x bf lymphocyte transfers the reduced alc is not due to inability of the f hybrid to respond with the full vigor of the parental strains nor is it due to an absolute requirement for homozygous presentation of the donor alc determinants it is concluded that impaired selfrecognition may be an important determinant of killing in alc as in some other nk cellmediated phenomena although ostensibly differing immunogenetically from hybrid resistance in mice alc includes a range of patterns of CR some of which are similar to those that characterize HR it is suggested that HR and alc may represent quantitative variants of a similar process
GS,glomerulosclerosis,TS-3534,to test the hypothesis that deletion of the TRP vanilloid type trpv channel exaggerates hypertensioninduced renal inflammatory response wildtype wt or trpvnull mutant trpv mice were subjected to uninephrectomy and DOCA docasalt treatment for wk MAP pressure map determined by radiotelemetry increased in docasalttreated wt or trpv mice whereas there was no difference in map between two strains at the baseline or after docasalt treatment docasalt treatment increased UAE and isoprostane in both wt and trpv mice and the increases were greater in magnitude in the latter CS periodic acidschiff and masons trichrome IF showed that kidneys of docasalttreated trpv mice exhibited more severe GS and tubulointerstitial injury compared with docasalttreated wt mice nfkappab assay showed that docasalt treatment increased renal G1 nfkappab concentrations in trpv mice compared with wt mice immunostaining and elisa CA revealed that docasalttreated trpv mice had enhanced renal infiltration of monocytemacrophage and lymphocyte as well as increased renal C2 of Th1 cytokine TNF il and chemokine mcp compared with docasalttreated wt mice renal icam but not vcam expression was also greater in docasalttreated trpv than wt mice dexamethasone dexa an IS drug conveyed a renoprotective effect that was greater in docasalttreated trpv compared with wt mice these data show that renal inflammation is exacerbated in docasalt hypertension when trpv gene is deleted and that the deterioration is ameliorated by dexa treatment indicating that trpv may act as a potential regulator of the inflammatory process to lessen renal injury in docasalt hypertension
CS,campaniform sensilla,TS-3535,to evaluate the DP of use of BLS bls ambulances in a pediatric population emergency medical service ems and pediatric emergency department ped records from an urban hospital ped for all children transported to ped by ambulance during a month study period were retrospectively reviewed excluded were T3 life support transport transport from other medical facility patients with chronic medical disability without acute decompensation and patients in police custody bls transport was considered inappropriate if no intervention by bls technicians minimal to no intervention in the ped and discharge without prescription medication of ambulance transports evaluated met entry criteria and transports met criteria for being inappropriate the mean charge for appropriate transport was and for inappropriate p the total charge for inappropriate transports was patients on federal assistance had a significantly higher rate of inappropriate transport compared with patients who had commercial insurance and those who self paid trauma was the most common cause for transport of which was inappropriate it was concluded that inappropriate bls transport of pediatric patients is common this use is costly and may disrupt the delivery of ems care to the remainder of the community efforts aimed at public education and providing alternative means of transport may significantly reduce cic leg of the locust schistocerca gregaria there are three CG of CS on the proximodorsal surface this T0 analyses the responses of the afferents from one group their connections with CE neurones and their actions during walking the afferents of the CS make direct excitatory connections with flexor tibiae motor neurones they also make direct connections with particular spiking local interneurones that make direct inhibitory output connections with the slow extensor tibiae motor neurone during walking extension movements of the tibiae during stance produce longitudinal tensile forces on the dorsal tibia that peak during mid stance before returning to zero prior to swing this decline in tension can activate the CS in turn this would lead to an inhibition of the extensor tibiae motor neurone and an excitation of the flexor tibiae motor neurones this therefore aids the transition from stance to swing during turning movements the tibia is flexed and the dorsal surface is put under compression this can also activate some of campaniform sensilla whose effect on the flexor motor neurones will reinforce the flexion of the tibia
IO,insideout,TS-3536,the hemodynamic force generated by blood flow is considered to be the physiologically most important stimulus for the PR of nitric oxide no and prostacyclin pgi from VE cells no and pgi then act on the underlying smooth muscle cells causing vasodilation and thus lowering blood pressure one critical early event occurring in this flowinduced regulation of V1 tone is that blood flow induces ca entry into VE cells which in turn leads to the formation of no here we report a MS capermeable channel in VE cells the activity of the channel was inhibited by brcgmp a membranepermeant activator of protein kinase g pkg in cellattached membrane patches the inhibition could be reversed by pkg inhibitor kt or h a direct application of active pkg in IO patches blocked the channel activity gd ni or skf also inhibited the channel activity a study of fluorescent ca entry revealed a striking pharmacological similarity between the ca entry elicited by flow and the MS capermeable channel we identified suggesting that this channel is the primary pathway mediating flowinduced ca entry into V1 endothelial cells
CG,cardiac glycosides,TS-3537,hepatic US transient elastography fibroscan is a new diagnostic method for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis there are limited data available on its use as a followup tool for patients with CHB in this T0 patients were enrolled hepatic fibrosis was evaluated by CL stiffness measurement and biopsy the biopsy criteria of the chinese program of prevention and cure for VH metavir classification and the modified chevaliers semiquantitative system were used for histologiinked to the c or c position of the steroidlike structure in contrast no appreciable contents of steroidlike compounds are found in danshen a wellknown chinese herb traditionally regarded as an ERP medicine promoting blood circulation instead magnesium lithospermate b mlb the major soluble ingredient in danshen is assumed to be responsible for the therapeutic effect by inhibiting na katpase in a manner comparable to CG neuroprotective effects of cardiac glycosides GS and mlb against ICM stroke were accordingly observed in a cortical brain slicebased CA MM whether the neuroprotection is also triggered by inhibition of na katpase remains to be investigated molecular modeling suggests that cardiac glycosides ginsenosides and mlb presumably bind to the same extracellular pocket of the na katpase alpha subunit
PA,polyacrylate,TS-3538,viscoelasticity is a useful parameter for characterizing the intrinsic properties of the crosslinked PA hydrogel used in cataplasm bases the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of various formulation parameters on the rheological characteristics of PA hydrogel the hydrogel layers were formed using a partially neutralized PA viscomateâ\x84¢ which contained acrylic acid and sodium acrylate in different copolymerization ratios as the crosslinked gel FR dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate daaa which produces aluminum ions was used as the crosslinking agent rheological analyses were performed using a AS amplitude sweep and a frequency sweep the results showed that greater amounts of acrylic acid in the structure of viscomate as well as higher concentrations of daaa and viscomate led to an increase in the EM g however greater amounts of acrylic acid in the structure of viscomate and higher concentrations of daaa had an opposite on the viscous modulus gâ\x80³ this might be owing to higher steric hindrance the results of this T0 can serve as guidelines for the optimization of formulations for cataplasms
PT,proficiency testing,TS-3539,a proficiency testing round was undertaken to assess the performance of laboratories to measure acrylamide in a sample of crispbread retail samples of crispbread were ground to a fine powder and after thorough mixing were packed in g units for distribution ten samples were selected at random and analyzed in duplicate for acrylamide by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry lcms standard statistical tests showed that the material was homogeneous for the purposes of PT test samples were distributed to laboratories in countries in europe north america australia and the middle east the results were analyzed by standard PT statistical procedures and laboratories were awarded zscores on the basis of their reported results based on a target standard deviation sigmap value taken from the horwitz equation for a robust mean value of mgkg acrylamide satisfactory results zscore within for those between and mgkg were obtained by of the laboratories that returned results only laboratory was unsatisfactory and had questionable results about equal numbers of laboratories used gas chromatography gcms and lcms procedures with about using msms and one using gc with electron capture detection there was no evident trend in performance or bias in results gcms and lcms data were evenly distributed across the population of laboratories reporting results
FD,fiber density,TS-3540,FPD pd is an agingassociated neurodegenerative disorder with progressive pathology involving the loss of midbrain dopaminergic SN neurotrophic factors are promising for pd GT they are integrally involved in the development of the nigrostriatal system cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor cdnf was recently discovered to be more selective and potent on preserving dopaminergic SN than other known trophic factors the present T0 examined the neuroprotective and functional restorative effects of cdnf overexpression in the striatum via recombinant adenoassociated virus type aavcdnf in hydroxydopamine ohda injected rats striatal delivery of aavcdnf was able to recover ohdainduced behavior deficits and resulted in a significant restoration of IMT hydroxylase immunoreactive thir SN in the substantia nigra pars compacta snpc and thir FD in the striatum pet analyses with cÎ²carbomethoxyÎ²fluorophenyltropane cÎ²cft probes suggested PET recovery of dopaminergic da SN our results indicate that striatal administration of aavcdnf was able to provide ERP neurorestoration in the ohdalesioned NS system and that it may be considered for future clinical applications in pd therapy
EM,electron micrographs,TS-3541,crystal distribution in articular cartilage of FA heads resected at hip arthroplasty for fracture of the femoral neck was examined in patients years by computerised image analysis of EM crystal content of the zenith did not differ from that of the infrafoveal region of the femoral head in the SF mm of the cartilage crystal area density percentage area of the section occupied by crystal profiles was higher in a zone microns than in the subjacent zone microns from the articular surface particularly in the zenith of the femoral head it was also higher on the SF towards the articular surface aspect than on the deep aspect of cells in perilacunar matrix crystal area density was similar in lacunar matrix perilacunar matrix and matrix remote from cells matrix containing cell debris was more heavily impregnated with crystals than any other site no difference in crystal content was observed in cartilage beneath articular surfaces which were ultrastructurally smooth or roughened the diminishing gradient of crystal area density with depth from the articular surface the absence of a marked spatial association with living cells and the impregnation of sites containing cell debris suggest that crystal deposition in these cases is not due primarily to chondrocyte activity
AT,assistive technology,TS-3542,the paper presents the BG for the increased interest for and use of welfare technology it discusses current definitions of welfare technology and suggests a typology of this technology based on the different definitions it compares the definitions with that of AT and endeavors to draw a clearer limit between them in particular related to possibilities to utilize the principle of universal design on welfare technology the issue of operationalization requirements of universal design to welfare technology through standardization is also discussed finally the paper suggests what elements should be part of a new definition of welfare technology

MD,moderate disability,TS-3544,drainage of cerebrospinal fluid by means of external lumbar drainage eld is controversial in the AD population with traumatic brain injury we report our experience with eld in the treatment of posttraumatic high intracranial pressure icp and the results of the LT followup in these patients we undertook clinical evaluation of patients with traumatic brain injury and high icp treated with secondtier measures or with firsttier measures if secondtier measures were contraindicated the T0 involved a retrospective review of collected data outcome at intensive care unit discharge and three to five years T3 injury were evaluated with the GOS the mean age of patients was years and were male the median IQ range glasgow coma score was to icp before and one hour after eld placement was and mmhg respectively a decrease in mmhg p eld was placed T3 a mean of days CSF fluid drainage was maintained for a mean of days four patients required eld replacement and one patient developed a cerebrospinal fluid infection no pupillary changes were noted within hours of eld placement longterm outcome was favourable good recovery or MD in of the patients studied the use of eld resulted in a marked decrease in icp these patients presented a good outcome in of the cases in the LT DUE few complications related with eld use were noted
EM,esophageal manometry,TS-3545,the effects of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt tips placement on esophageal motor function and GE reflux were investigated in patients with EV in six men with EV EM and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed before and days after tips placement intraesophageal EPM was performed in the four patients with severe esophageal varices defined as the largest sized varices following tips placement findings were compared with those in six healthy men controls who underwent esophageal manometry and intraesophageal ph monitoring the esophageal varices resolved or were reduced T3 tips placement resting lower esophageal sphincter les pressures were similar in the study group before and T3 tips placement and in the control subjects the incidence and progression of esophageal contractions were similar in the study group before and T3 tips placement and in the control subjects at cm above the les the amplitude of esophageal contraction after tips placement was significantly higher than that before tips placement at and cm above the les the amplitude of esophageal contraction in the control subjects was significantly higher than that in the T0 group before and T3 tips placement esophageal acid SE time after tips placement was similar to that in the controls tips placement is a useful treatment that improves esophageal motor CF without the occurrence of pathologic gastroesophageal reflux
BS,bone scan,TS-3546,in an unselected series of cases of SCFE scfe we observed an incidence of of epiphyseal reduction mostly unintentional reduction indicated physeal instability and was associated with an effusion detected by US on admission and inability to bear weight the true prevalence of instability may be higher since an effusion was noted in cases on the initial sonographic assessment serial radiographs showed reduction in with an average NC of degrees in the headneck angle serial sonography showed reduction in out of cases with an average NC of mm in MSD in two cases reduction was seen on sonography but not on radiography of the hips which showed subsequent reduction had had a BS on admission three showed initial epiphyseal avascularity but only one PD to symptomatic avascular CN all SD hips had normal epiphyseal vascularity on the initial BS this indicates the importance of injury from the initial MSD in causing avascular CN rather than effusion V1 compromise or iatrogenic injury from gentle repositioning physeal instability in scfe is common and should be assessed clinically on admission it is indicated by joint effusion or inability to bear weight a slip is very unlikely to be unstable in a child able to bear weight and with no sonographic effusion
PSC,platelet shape change,TS-3547,the dialdehyde derivative of adp oadp at concentrations approaching the millimolar range induces human blood platelets to undergo the transition from discoid to globular morphology the shape change but is incapable of inducing aggregation when incubated with platelets for min before addition of the agonist oadp acts as a competitive inhibitor of shape change and aggregation induced by adp under these conditions secretion and hence aggregation induced by low concentrations of collagen and secretion and hence secondary aggregation induced by adrenaline thrombin and vasopressin are also inhibited by this analogue in addition oadp stimulates the rate of primary aggregation induced by adrenaline and causes partial inhibition of primary aggregation induced by thrombin or vasopressin when longer preincubation times are employed the extent of inhibition with respect to all agonists except for high concentrations of collagen is increased and the competitive character of the inhibition with respect to adp is no longer apparent incubation of human platelets with the dialdehyde derivative of atp oatp causes effects similar to those described for oadp except that the analogue neither induces PSC nor stimulates the rate of primary aggregation induced by adrenaline in addition oatp fails to cause significant inhibition of PSC induced by serotonin the extent and character of inhibition caused by addition of oatp is not a function of the time of incubation the dialcohol derivatives of adp and atp and oratp effect the aggregation properties of human blood platelets in a manner generally resembling those observed for the dialdehyde analogues however oradp is only weakly ERP in causing PSC and stimulating the rate of primary aggregation induced by adrenaline and does not inhibit secretion induced by adrenaline collagen thrombin and vasopressin the extent of inhibition by oradp increases only slightly with increased time of incubation the data suggest that oadp acts as a partial agonist and oatp as an antagonist at the PLT adp receptor but that platelet membrane stabilisation also results from interaction with these dialdehyde analogues such membrane stabilisation does not complicate the interaction of platelets with oradp which appears to act as a classical antagonist for the adp receptor
FPR,fluorescence photobleaching recovery,TS-3548,by use of LM and FPR we have studied a structures that form in a system composed of copolymerized rabbit muscle actin and chicken gizzard filamin and b the brownian motion of inert tracer macromolecules in this matrix we have used as tracers sizefractionated fluoresceinlabeled ficoll and submicron PS latex particles in factin solutions the relative diffusion coefficient of the tracer was a decreasing CF of both tracer size and actin concentration also a percolation transition for latex particle mobility was found to follow a form suggested by ogston ogston a g trans faraday soc for random filament matrices the inclusion of filamin before polymerization resulted in increased tracer mobility below a filamin dimertoactin monomer ratio of no structural features were observed in the LM at or above this ratio for all actin concentrations tested a threedimensional network of filament bundles was clearly discriminated latex particles were always excluded from the bundles by use of a dialysis optical cell in which polymerization could be initiated with very little hydrodynamic stress we found that filamin can spontaneously bundle factin a simple physical picture explains how dynamics can affect the structural result of coassembly and provides a further hypothesis on the balance between random filament crosslinking and largescale bundling control of this balance may be important in cytoplasmic motile events
SFM,serumfree medium,TS-3549,it has long been known that nacylethanolamine phospholipids nacylphosphatidylethanolamine nacyl pe and nacylethanolamines naes accumulate in mammalian tissues undergoing degenerative membrane changes associated with necrosis here we studied the effects of AS AF uvb irradiation and SS deprivation on the endogenous levels of nacyl pe and nae in mouse epidermal jb p cells we found that n and n are the predominant amidelinked fatty acids in both nacyl pe and nae in these cells uvb irradiation and SS deprivation resulted in significantly increased C2 of nacyl pe and nae especially n nacyl pe and nae uvb challenge increased the cellular content of anandamide n nae but this increase was the lowest of all naes measured serum deprivation resulted in a decreased cellular anandamide level as well as a decrease in n nacyl pe interestingly the replacement of SFM with medium containing vv fetal CS after h of serum deprivation restored nacyl pe and nae C2 almost CR within h these data suggest the involvement of nacyl pe and nae in cellular responses to AS
BF,basal forebrain,TS-3550,the insulinsensitive glucose transporter glut expressed primarily in peripheral tissue has recently been detected also in the BB demonstrating a regionspecific CSD to identify the chemical nature of neurons expressing glut and to disclose whether glutcontaining SN also express the glut isoform combined in situ hybridization for glut mrna and doublelabeling immunocytochemistry for glut and different cellular markers was performed in BB sections through rat BF CBF cortex hippocampus and cerebellum in all brain regions examined glut immunoreactivity was exclusively found in neurons and glutimmunoreactive cells were colocalized with neurons expressing glut mrna in rat BF cholinergic and parvalbumincontaining GABA acidergic cells demonstrated glut immunoreactivity whereas calretinin calbindind and neuronal nitric oxide synthasecontaining neurons did not express glut protein because brain glut transporters have been suggested to play a role in rapidly providing additional glucose to SN under conditions of highenergy demand the selective presence of glut in basal forebrain cholinergic cells may explain the specific vulnerability of these cells to a lack of glucose supply
CB,cuprolinic blue,TS-3551,in order to contrast anionic CS in mouse lung alveoli two staining procedures were applied a IF with ruthenium red and alcian blue and b staining with CB in a CEC method the ruthenium redalcian blue staining procedure revealed electrondense granules in the AM basement membrane the granules were closely associated with the epithelial cell membrane and continued to stain even when the procedure was carried out at a low ph indicating the presence of sulphate groups in the LG T3 IF with CB electrondense filaments also closely associated with the CM became visible in the basement membrane of type i epithelial cells their length depended on the mgcl concentration used during IF at m mgcl the length was mostly within the range nm using a modified cuprolinic blue method the appearance of the filaments closely resembled that of spread proteoglycan monomers with their sidechains condensed the basement membrane of type ii epithelial cells also contained filaments positive towards cuprolinic blue their length however was smaller in comparison with those of type i epithelial cells the filaments lay in one plane and provided the whole alveolus with an almost continuous sheet of anionic sites cuprolinic blue staining also revealed filaments in the basement membrane of the capillary endothelial cells furthermore cuprolinic bluepositive filaments average length about nm became apparent in close contact with collagen fibrils and separated from each other according to the main banding period of the collagen fibrils about nm indicating a TPS ultrastructural interaction between these two components filaments connecting collagen fibrils with each other were also detected
BC,body condition,TS-3552,BC scoring using a point scale with quarterpoint divisions was performed on holstein dairy cows that began their second or later lactation in august september or october BC was scored beginning on PPD and subsequently at postpartum days and blood samples were obtained on the same dates kilograms of milk produced per cow was measured daily body condition score and changes in body condition score were evaluated in relation to daily milk production cumulative day milk yield and SS urea nitrogen and cholesterol concentrations average daily milk production during week was indicative of cumulative day production but not of day milk yields cows that calved with body condition score greater than or equal to did not differ in average daily milk production cumulative day milk yield or day milk yield compared with cows that calved with BC score less than cows that calved with body condition score greater than or equal to lost more condition than did cows that calved with BC score less than body condition score at calving and amount of body condition loss interacted with the rate of change in daily milk production serum urea nitrogen concentration did not differ for cows grouped by cumulative day milk production or for cows grouped by amount of condition loss SS cholesterol values were higher than previously reported values and increased directly with milk production serum cholesterol values were inversely related to condition loss but changes in cholesterol concentration were not related to condition loss
AR,anterior resection,TS-3553,malignant tumors of the LB become often clinically evident as an obstruction in cases specially the neoplasms at the splenic flexure or descending colon different factors urgency age Tc distension and lack of adequate bowel preparation influence therapeutic choice specially about the bowel resection and one stage anastomosis twentysix patient with neoplastic stenosis of the C1 bowel of ascending colon and proximal transverse of splenic flexure or descending colon of the sigma of the rectum have been surgically treated patient have been subjected to right emicolectomy and ileotransverse anastomosis to hartmans T0 to AR of the rectum to left hemicolectomy and to resection of the sigma with colic on table irrigation and onestage anastomosis to colostomy to palliative ileocolic bypass two patients died in postoperative period in patients subjected to onestage procedures for left colic stenosis the authors havent observed L1 complications but one patient developed an anastomic leakage conservative treated in stenosis localized to ascending colon or hepatic flexure standard surgical T0 is right emicolectomy in patients affected by cancer of descending colon the hartmanns T0 is considered the more rational procedure even if of the patients arent reoperated on for reconstruction the onestage anastomosis is indicated only in selected cases specially subjected to tpn before surgery or balancing of the metabolic parameters and to antibiotic prophylaxis the subtotal or total colectomy is indicated when signs of colic perforation are found or when the colon is massively dilatated or there are signs of colonic necrosis or in case of other lesions of the LB preoperatively known
RT,resting tension,TS-3554,several risk AF for cardiovascular disease amongst a sample of urban chinese women were investigated these factors included body mass index bmi waist hip ratio total blood cholesterol tc hdlcholesterol and lpa levels blood pressure CS family history of chronic disease dietary habits and frequency of selected FI the subjects were found to have coronary risks with respect to bmi and tc level both of which increased with age of the women hypertension hdlcholesterol and lpa levels appeared not to pose as risk factors amongst these subjects dietary habits and intthe heel is realigned can any residual forefoot valgus be assessed and a hindfoot procedure may alter the RT of the digital flexors and extensors finally if a patient has purely dynamic clawtoes preoperatively the toes may appear perfectly normal in the operating room with the ankle plantar flexed tightness of the flexor digitorum longus should be elicited by bringing the ankle up to neutral as a final check the variety of foot deformities in cmt present a unique challenge to the orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon it is vital for the patient and physician to remember that cmt is an inexorably progressive disease and an initially good result can deteriorate with changing motor function with meticulous attention to the neurologic examination and the balance of supple and fixed deformities in the foot very satisfying outcomes usually can be obtained
MI,mutual information,TS-3555,the encoding and processing of timedependent signals into sequences of action potentials of sensory SN is still a challenging theoretical problem although with some effort it is possible to quantify the flow of information in the modelfree FR of shannons information theory this yields just a single number the MI rate this rate does not indicate which aspects of the CS- are encoded several studies have identified mechanisms at the cellular and network level leading to low or HP filtering of information ie the selective coding of slow or fast CS- components however these findings rely on an approximation specifically on the qualitative SMB of the coherence function an approximate frequencyresolved measure of information flow whose quality is generally unknown here we develop an assumptionfree method to measure a frequencyresolved information rate about a timedependent gaussian stimulus we demonstrate its application for three paradigmatic descriptions of neural firing an inhomogeneous poisson process that carries a signal in its instantaneous firing rate an integrator neuron stochastic integrateandfire MM driven by a timedependent stimulus and the synchronous spikes fired by two commonly driven integrator SN in PA with previous coherencebased estimates we find that poisson and IF neurons are broadband and lowpass filters of information respectively the bandpass information filtering observed in the coherence of synchronous spikes is confirmed by our frequencyresolved information measure in some but not all parameter configurations our results also explicitly show how the responseresponse coherence can fail as an upper bound on the information rate
ML,monolayer,TS-3556,in response to an estrogen confluent monolayers of mcf cell cultures develop multicellular nodules termed foci postconfluent OD of foci occurs with physiologic C2 of betaestradiol and are inhibited by various antiestrogens acting through either the estrogen or Ah receptors in the present paper we report that disruption of the terminal sugars on membrane receptors results in inhibition of foci treatment with unitsml of betagalactosidase CR inhibited the OD of foci while leaving the ML of cells IN trials with alphamannosidase resulted in a similar but less potent inhibition of foci lectinfluorescent conjugates rca ricinus communis agglutinin and cona canavalia ensiformis agglutinin were used to identify membrane surface carbohydrates on mcf cells binding of the rcafluorescent conjugate was inhibited by cotreatment with Gal or lactose binding of conafluorescent conjugate was significantly inhibited by mannose and nacetylglucosamine this is the first report of inhibition of foci OD in mcf cell cultures by disruption of surface carbohydrates on membrane receptors
HS,hereditary spherocytosis,TS-3557,a patient with hereditary spherocytosis gave rise to lower C2 of both erythrocyte and serum cholesterols and SS lipoproteins than normal subjects abnormal shape of the LP particles was observed by electronmicroscopic examination as well as the spheroidal shape of red cells lipids of fresh SP tissue of the patient T3 splenectomy for the treatment of splenomegaly were extracted isolated and analyzed particularly different glycosphingolipids were also chemically identified and analyzed the total lipids accounted for of the dry tissue weight and consisted of cholesterol simple lipids phospholipids and glycosphingolipids particularly the glycosphingolipids were composed of monohexosyl ceramide lactosyl ceramide digalactosylglucosyl ceramide globoside i and hematoside it was found that the globoside i and hematoside increased remarkably in the spleen of patient with HS and that monohexosyl ceramide contained not only glucosyl ceramidlectrocardiogram and of electrical stimulation has led to a number of arguments for the hypothesis of a reentry circuit which uses the right branch in the reverse direction and then the anterior and posterior subbranches alternately in the normal direction the recurrent attacks of ART can be prevented by permanent VVI stimulation at a rate above that which occurs between the attacks however the relief which this affords has not altered the prognosis of this arrhythmia which remains very poor
LTP,laser trabeculoplasty,TS-3558,the paper presents a case of a pseudoexfoliative glaucoma previously treated with ALT in a tertiary center who was scheduled for canaloplasty in the ophthalmology department of the county hospital piatra neamt romania although the status post LTP is not among the best indications for canaloplasty the article confirms the fact that this procedure can also be successfully performed in these cases
PA,propionic acidemia,TS-3559,cardiomyopathy is a frequent complication in propionic acidemia it is mostly rapidly fatal and independent of the metabolic control or medical intervention here we present the reversal of a severe cardiomyopathy after liver transplantation in a patient with PA and the longterm stability T3 ten years liver transplantation in patients with propionic acidemia may be considered a valid and longlasting treatment when cardiomyopathy is progressive and unresponsive to medical therapy
NF,nodular fasciitis,TS-3560,intraoral nodular nodular fasciitis is a rare entity that is important to recognize because it may simulate a malignancy clinically and histologically the rapid growth and high mitotic index seen in NF may suggest a malignant neoplastic process but it is generally considered to be a benign reactive proliferation recognizing the unique histologic features of nodular fasciitis is important to avoid a possible misdiagnosis as a malignancy leading to unnecessary further treatment
PE,pseudomonas exotoxin,TS-3561,sera were obtained from individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type or from hivuninfected individuals before or T3 vaccination with recombinant gp these sera were evaluated for activity antagonistic to the cellkilling activity of the chimeric PE hybrid protein scdpe for these studies chinese hamster ovary cho cells were transfected with a chimeric plasmid encoding the tat rev and env genes of hiv and a cell line was selected for stable expression of the envelope glycoproteins at the cell surface choenv cytotoxicity of scdpe for choenv in the presence or absence of added human SS was quantitated spectrophometrically following enzymatic reduction of a tetrazolium bromide within the mitochondria of viable cells mtt assay several hiv sera inhibited the cytotoxic activity of scdpe the antagonist had properties consistent with those of immunoglobulins in that it was ST absorbed by protein a and reversible by increasing the concentration of scdpe of hiv sera which strongly reacted with gp also potently inhibited scdpe cytotoxicity and cytotoxicity was inhibited by sera from some hiv individuals after but not before immunization with gp these data suggested a role for antibody to gp in the antagonistic activity however not all sera with antibody to gp antagonized scdpe cytotoxicity and high levels of antagonist activity were frequently found in hiv sera lacking immunoblotdetectable antibody to gp or antibody to either cd or pe grouping of the hiv sera according to the patients absolute number of cd cells revealed that the degree of inhibition of scdpe cytotoxicity approached a gaussian CSD suggesting that persons with cd cell counts between and mm may be more likely to possess significant C2 of SS antagonist this data have implications for the clinical development of scdpe or other scdbased therapeutics in the management of hiv infection
CI,convergence insufficiency,TS-3562,to measure the difference in CI symptom survey scores for reading vs favorite n or disappearance of the axon were observed by transmission electron microscopy in the ean group cd and iba increased significantly in the structures characterized by separation or swelling of the myelin lamellae and increased slightly in the structures characterized by vesicular of the myelin lamellae s decreased in the structures characterized by vesicular disorganization or separation of the myelin lamellae and NF-M decreased in the structures characterized by separation of the myelin lamellae furthermore we found that iba were positive in the myelin sheath and overlapped with s which significantly indicated that schwann cells played as MLC during the disease progression of ena our findings may be a significant supplement for the knowledge of ean MM and may offer a novel sight on the treatment of guillainbarrÃ© syndrome
SP,septum,TS-3563,a yearold female was admitted with sudden ON dyspnea mild oppressive CP and severe anxiety disorder patient had history of hypertension dyslipidemia smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on admission blood pressure was and HR rate was bpm TTE te and contrast tomography showed a thin SP with an abnormal left and right ventricular contraction with an apical ballooning pattern and mild increase of cardiac enzymes at the th day of admission the patient presented PS and signs of CHF and developed cardiogenic shock ekg showed an inversion of t waves in all precordial leads in a new te a VSP vsp in the apical portion of the SP was seen coronary angiogram showed angiographically normal coronary arteries with a diagnosis of vsp in takotsubo cardiomyopathy a percutaneous procedure to repair the vsp was performed days after admission the vsp was closed with an amplatzer device te performed hours after showed significant improvement of VF and good apposition of the amplatzer device three days later she was discharged from the hospital to our knowledge this is the first reported case of a vsp in a tcm repaired percutaneously with an occluder device
HD,huntingtons disease,TS-3564,excitotoxicity is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of HD hd glu is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the BB and excess activation of glutamate receptors can cause neuronal dysfunction and death glutamate transporters regulate the extracellular concentration of glutamate glt is the most abundant glutamate transporter and accounts for most of the glu transport in the brain administration of ceftriaxone an antibiotic that increases the PET expression of glt can improve the behavioral phenotype of the r mouse model of hd to test the hypothesis that glt expression critically affects the hd disease process we generated a novel mouse model that is heterozygous for the null S2 of glt and carries the r transgene double mutation we demonstrated that the protein expression of total glt as well as two of its isoforms is decreased within the SC and striatum of weekold r mice and that the expression of eaac was decreased in the striatum protein expression of glt was further decreased in the SC and striatum of the double mutation mice compared with the r mice at weeks however the effects of the r transgene on weight loss accelerating rotarod climbing and pawclasping were not exacerbated in these double mutants na dependent glutamate uptake into synapatosomes isolated from the striatum and cortex of weekold r mice was unchanged compared with controls these results suggest that changes in glt expression or CF per se are unlikely to potentiate or ameliorate the progression of hd
SA,splenic artery,TS-3565,for the treatment of hypersplenism transcatheter embolization of the SA and collateral vessels is an alternative to splenectomy notably in highrisk or immunosuppressed patients after arterial occlusion and thrombosis followup computed tomography scans depict progressive changes in the extent and appearance of splenic infarcts such that these changes correlate with improved platelet counts computed tomography thus performs the unique role of identifying TPS patterns of infarction and also differentiating internal defects such as suppurative gaseous or liquefaction CN
MT,matingtype,TS-3566,MT switching in the fission yeast s pombe is initiated by a dna doublestrand break dsb between the mat cassette and the h homology box the matcisacting mutant smt abolishes MT switching and is shown here to be a bp deletion this deletion starts in the middle of the h homology box bp from the site of the dsb and extends into the flanking region distal to mat the CS of the region distal to h in the wildtype is also presented in this region we observe a bias in the CSD of purine residues between the two dna strands
AS,alport syndrome,TS-3567,we describe a novel mutational T0 in african american siblings with AR AS both siblings were compound heterozygotes for abnormal dna sequences in exon of the cola gene pargx cgatga and pargx cgatga these are nonsense mutations in the noncollagenous domain resulting in premature termination codons and have not been previously reported in an african american population in which AR alport syndrome is rarely seen complete sequencing of the cola and cola genes may be necessary to identify the underlying mutation and confirm the diagnosis
LT,after lung transplantation,TS-3568,retransplantation in adult lung SPK recipients developing progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome as a consequence of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder ptld therapy has not been reported in the literature literature on ptld LT is limited mostly to case reports or small case series limiting the validity of conclusions
SFM,serumfree media,TS-3569,human peripheral blood monocytes hpbm cultured in the absence of serum were found to convert into a state of high AF which was expressed by their ability to support LP after a prolonged culture in SFM the monocytederived cells were highly viable increased in size and had developed veils and dendritiform elongations paralleling the increase in accessory function we found a decrease in the expression of markers typical of monocytes and macrophages mÃ¸ approaching the phenotype of lymphoid dendritic cells we here define conditions for reproducibly generating these monocytederived accessory cells mac in various serumfree media thus offering a novel differentiation MM at highly defined SC conditions
CB,cord blood,TS-3570,analyses completed on samples collected between and showed that about of inuit newborns from northern quebec canada had a CB lead concentration equal to or greater than micromoll an intervention level adopted by many governmental agencies a comparison between the CB lead isotope ratios of inuit and southern quebec newborns showed that lead sources for these populations were different our investigation suggests that lead shots used for game hunting were an important source of lead SE in the inuit population a cohort study conducted in three inuit communities shows a significant decrease of CB lead concentrations T3 a public health MI to reduce the use of lead shot lead shot ammunition can be a L1 and preventable source of human SE to lead
AA,alcoholpreferring,TS-3571,the VTA area vta and its projections have been implicated in the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse selectively bred AA p and alcoholnonpreferring np lines o improve the diagnosis of disseminated candidosis a nested pcr technique with primer pairs was used to increase the sensitivity we were able to detect candida dna in SS and tissue samples from experimentally INF mice as well as in SS samples from candidemia patients and patients with deepseated candida infection our pcr could detect as little as pg candida albicans dna the pcr method was more CS than culture in both the mouse experiments and the patients with deep candidosis were pcr positive and blood culture positive and of similar sensitivity in candidemia patients were blood culture positive the relatively short processing time of pcr when compared with culturing its sensitivity as well as the possibility of using serum samples for analysis all helped improve the diagnostics in deepseated candidosis and candidemia
CR,calorie restriction,TS-3572,CR modulates spontaneous and chemically induced tumors and increases maximal life span in exp animals however the mechanism by which calorie restriction exerts its ameliorating effects is not fully elucidated although reduced C2 of reactive oxygen species ros by CR has generated much interest in the present study we have determined whether or not calorie restriction would affect the mutagenic response in rats treated with bleomycin blm a radiomimetic drug that is associated with dna damage by a free radical mechanism fourteen weeks after weaning the rats were divided into two CG AL alfed and CR both al and calorierestricted animals were injected with and mg blmkg or with phosphatebuffered saline pbs and they were killed weeks post drug treatment lymphocytes from the spleens were seeded in well microtiter plates to determine mutant frequency in the hypoxantine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase hprt gene the mutant frequency in the blmtreated rats was higher in al males p and al females p than in their calorierestricted counterparts the difference in mutagenic response relative to al males and al females appeared unrelated to a low percent CE seen in the males since the mean absolute number of hprt mutant clones was higher in the al males compared to the females a reduction in animal weight by calorie restriction was significant in both sexes p but the dose effect appeared NS the results indicate that calorie NI of reduced the mutagenic response of blm a compound known to induce oxidative dna damage and suggest a possible decrease in ros as a function of CR
PN,pyelonephritis,TS-3573,urinary tract infections utis are common conditions in clinical practice for uncomplicated utis the causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles are generally predictable and empiric short course day antibiotic therapy after an abbreviated laboratory workup is advocated acute PN requires a week antibiotic course often with initial parenteral therapy women with frequent recurrences of utis may require intermittent selftreatment or continuous or postcoital antibiotic prophylaxis catheterassociated utis generally only require treatment if the patient shows signs of systemic infection treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is only recommended in certain circumstances careful consideration of the clinical circumstances the patients known or predicted urinary tract anatomy and the antibiotic susceptibility of the bacterial pathogens are critical factors in the choice of AGA therapy for urinary tract infections
RA,right,TS-3574,hind limb blood flow was measured in lambs of from dGA delivered by caesarean section to month after birth term is about days under chloralose anaesthesia V1 resistance g wet wt increased progressively with age there was reflex femoral vascular tone from the earliest age studied as shown by vasodilatation on cutting the sciatic nerve on asphyxia by cord occlusion reflex FA vasoconstriction began earlier and was somewhat greater in older foetal lambs at all ages and T3 denervation of the hind limb there was vasodilatation T3 local ischaemia and a vasoconstriction of delayed onset during asphyxia attributed to PR of noradrenaline into the circulation the vasoconstrictor effect of noradrenaline in immature lambs was at least as great as at term or in the P0 injections of minimal effective doses of cyanide were used to localize possible chemoreceptor sites in foetal lambs injection into the left atrium caused a rise of arterial pressure femoral vasoconstriction and a complex change in HR rate usually bradycardia but rarely any respiratory movement T3 atropine cyanide caused a large tachycardia all responses were much reduced or abolished by C2 vagotomy injection of the same doses of cyanide into a jugular vein the RA IVT pulmonary or common carotid arteries of foetal lambs caused negligible cardiovascular or respiratory effects whereas injection into the carotids of P0 lambs caused a profound hyperpnoea it is concluded that the aortic chemoreceptors are active in the foetus are supplied from the left HR and that they probably represent the primary defence in blood gas homeostasis by their effects on the circulation

PC,posterior compartment,TS-3576,clinical appearance of foot deformity after tibial shaft fracture resulting from the contracture of the deep PC muscles of the leg is presented in this paper the contracture may be caused by mechanical damage to the muscles or vessels or by deep PC syndrome cavus deformity shortening of the foot length claw big toe and hammer lesser toes are frequently unnoticed at the followup examination T3 surgical treatment of the tibial fracture these findings are based on analysis of patients treated surgically for leg shafts fracture with ao method
CH,chloral hydrate,TS-3577,the excitatory responses of neurones in the ACC of the rat to iontophoretically applied substance p sp are reduced by noradrenaline na applied iontophoretically or released from noradrenergic pathways in order to determine the receptor involved in this inhibitory effect we have studied the effects of a number of receptorspecific adrenergic agonists and antagonists on responses of cingulate neurones to sp in rats anaesthetized with CH low iontophoretic currents na of na adrenaline and the betaagonist CB all strongly reduced responses to sp isoprenaline was also ERP but less consistently so although problems were experienced with its iontophoretic release from micropipettes the alpha agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine were also able to reduce responses to sp however this reduction required higher iontophoretic currents na and was associated with depressant effects on baseline FR the alpha agonist clonidine was only weakly AS at high currents and this too was associated with depression of baseline firing similar weak effects were noted with dopamine the inhibitory effects of na on sp responses were convincingly blocked or reversed by the betaantagonist practolol but not by the alpha antagonist prazosin the reduction of sp responses by phenylephrine was also blocked by practolol but unaffected by prazosin finally reduction of sp excitations by activation of the coeruleocortical pathway was also blocked by practolol applied iontophoretically to the cortical cells these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of na on sp responsiveness in the cingulate cortex is mediated by betaadrenoreceptors
BS,body surface,TS-3578,in the farrowing houses the electric dynamic katathermometer edk was used to determine the thermal conditions in boxes for piglets heated by electric infraradiators eiz with an input of w the density of heat flow of the edk sensor in the boxes which characterizes the cooling properties of this environment was zero or only very low if the infraradiators were installed to cm above the floor of the boxes i e so as to temper the air to a temperature recommended by the standard this is apparently caused by the relatively great radiation from the infraradiator which is not registered by the mercury thermometer but is absorbed by the BS of the piglets and may lead to their overheating a desirable increase in the cooling properties of the box environment and of the other spaces of the farrowing house was achieved by decreasing the infraradiator input to w and suspending them cm above the floor of the boxes their fixation at a greater height allowed the further effective regulation of the heat conditions in the boxes while at the same time cutting down electric SE consumption by a half
PF,proflavine,TS-3579,the ability of three heterotricyclic dyes to photosensitize dermatophyte fungi was studied with trichophyton mentagrophytes and microsporum gypseum in vitro studies showed that methylene blue NR and PF were capable of killing these fungi when used in conjunction with broadspectrum light PF however killed both fungi most rapidly and was used for further studies fungal killing by proflavine plus light was dependent on dye concentration ph CS wavelength and light intensity based on the in vitro studies a treatment regimen was developed for in vivo use on experimentally INF animals when treatment of guinea pigs inoculated with t mentagrophytes was begun during fungal invasion lesion formation at inoculated sites was either prevented or substantially reduced when treatment was begun T3 lesion formation however lightplusdyed treated CS showed only slightly faster curing than UT CS
RS,rankin scale,TS-3580,the ability to return to work rtw postinjury is one of the primary goals of rehabilitation the modified RS mrs is a validated simple scale used to assess the PET status of stroke patients during rehabilitation we sought to determine the applicability of mrs in predicting rtw postinjury in a GA trauma population the trauma registry was queried for patients aged to years discharged from to a telephone interview for each patient included questions about employment status and PCS ability to determine the mrs patients who had rtw postinjury were compared with those who had not nrtw two hundred and thirtyfour patients met the inclusion criteria of these patients rtw and did nrtw patients who did nrtw were significantly older had longer length of stay and higher rates of inhospital complications MVA revealed that older patients were less likely to rtw odds ratio p and patients with a mRS â\x89¤ were times more likely to rtw odds ratio p in conclusion an mrs â\x89¤ was independently associated with a high likelihood of returning to work postinjury this is the first T0 that shows applicability of the mrs for predicting rtw postinjury in a trauma population
IM,internal medicine,TS-3581,multidisciplinary approach for proximal FA fracture was organized in the hospital inter and intra division obstacles were discussed T3 general consensus of the team was obtained manuals and guidelines of the each division were prepared in addition to this the electrical chart specific for the PT femoral fracture was made which enables to eliminate inhospital REF letters as the results all patients were examined by IM doctors at the time of admission average interval from the time of admission to surgery became days closer relationship with psychiatrist made early detection and treatment of delirium possible after changing the system to check the antiosteoporosis medication at the time of discharge by the ward pharmacist dramatically increased the prescription rate form percent to percent

NL,neural lobe,TS-3585,nineteen patients with malignant tumors were treated with a combination of bolus add form of the Arg vasopressin avp F0 we have now studied the turnover and PR of the npgp component using a combination of invivo radiolabel incorporation and OHP liquid chromatography measurement of the NL content of slabelled peptides at various times T3 hypothalamic injection of scysteine demonstrated that the oxytocinrelated products accumulated more rapidly than the avprelated products the relative amounts of scysteine incorporated into npgp and the avprelated neurophysin npavp changed markedly with time after invivo labelling invitro incubation of neurosecretory LG prepared from neural lobes h T3 radiolabel injection produced a time and temperaturedependent conversion of npgp to npavp incubation at degrees c for h produced a decrease in snpgp with a concomitant increase in snpavp whilst there were no changes in the other slabelled components invitro stimulation of radiolabelled neural lobes by mmk evoked a cadependent PR of npgp as well as the other expected neurosecretory components and the amount of npgp released reflected its neural lobe content we conclude that the npgp component found in guineapig neural lobes is a biosynthetic intermediate most of which is further processed to npavp however some npgp may also be secreted from the neural lobe in an intact form
SR,stochastic resonance,TS-3586,a simple SR algorithm based on linear modulation was developed to amplify and detect weak chromatographic peaks the SO chromatographic peak is often distorted when using the traditional SR algorithm due to the presence of high C2 of noise in the new algorithm a linear modulated doublewell potential is introduced to correct for the distortion of the output peak method parameter selection is convenient and intuitive for linear modulation in order to achieve a better SNR ratio for the SO signal the performance of twolayer SR was evaluated by comparing it with waveletbased SR the proposed algorithm was applied to the quantitative analysis of DMS and the determination of chloramphenicol residues in milk and the good linearity of the method demonstrated that it is an effective tool for detecting weak chromatographic peaks
ECC,excitationcontraction coupling,TS-3587,cardiac myocyte ECC is complex there are many systems involved that interact to form varied but welltuned effects that are essential to contractile regulation nearly all of these systems are cadependent and ca homeostasis within the myocyte is carefully controlled contractile activation results from ca entry via ca current and ca PR from the sarcoplasmic reticulum sr ca extrusion from the cytosol is controlled by ca transport by the NCE the sr capump which is balanced by a ca leak out of the sr and slower systems including ca transport by mitochondria and the sarcolemmal capump these systems interact to regulate the amount of ca within the cell at rest most of which is stored within the sr the amount of ca released from the sr depends nonlinearly upon sr ca specifically the free sr ca casr the relationship is particularly steep at high casr where spontaneous PR can take place resulting in electrical arrhythmias in many models of heart failure sr ca is redpecies of the a gambiae complex has been shown by the extent of chromosomal inversion polymorphisms and more recently by divergence at the molecular level analysis by pcr of a field population of a gambiae complex from the zambezi valley area of kanyemba RNA zimbabwe showed the coexistence of three sibling species a arabiensis a gambiae and a quadriannulatus molecular characterization of the a gambiae ss material revealed the sympatric presence of the two molecular forms s and m within a sample of eight this is the first record of the coexistence of these two molecular forms in southern africa
SP,sulfapyridine,TS-3588,amantadine is a drug with a primary amino group and consequently a likely candidate for metabolism by acetylation this study assessed the possibility that a persons polymorphic nat acetylator phenotype could be used to predict the extent of AMA acetylation thirtyeight normal healthy volunteers were nat acetylator phenotyped with sulfapyridine of the six fastest and six slowest SP acetylators two and three respectively had acetylamantadine present microg in the h urine collection there was no rho between nat acetylator phenotype and AMA acetylation p and no difference in the total urine AMA excreted over h between acetylators and nonacetylators vs mg respectively mean sd acetylamantadine represented median of urinary drug content over h our data confirm that amantadine is acetylated in humans and demonstrate for the first time that the extent is not correlated with nat acetylator phenotype parallel in vitro enzyme studies indicate the possibility that neither nati nor nat is responsible for acetylation of AMA
CP,classical pathway,TS-3589,alveolar macrophages are thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of inhalational anthrax receptors present on macrophages that mediate phagocytosis of bacillus anthracis spores have yet to be completely defined to begin to determine if soluble factors that are present in the lung such as immunoglobulin and complement are involved we characterized the IB of human igg and c to the surface of b anthracis spores at different concentrations of nonimmune human SS furthermore we investigated the uptake of b anthracis spores by human monocytederived macrophages in the presence of nonimmune human serum here we show that B6 is bound to b anthracis spores and is activated through the CP pathway by igg bound to the spore surface furthermore we show that c serves as an opsonin for b anthracis spores resulting in enhanced phagocytosis by human macrophages these studies provide evidence that nonimmune SS contains igg which binds to b anthracis spores but is not sufficient to initiate phagocytosis however surfacebound igg does initiate the CP of complement activation which is AS in the lung resulting in deposition of the opsonin cb on the spore surface
LC,lamina cribrosa,TS-3590,glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies that have in common a slow progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells rgc and their axons resulting in a distinct appearance of the NVD and a concomitant pattern of visual loss the LC lc is a meshlike structure at the ONH through which the rgc axons and retinal blood vessels pass glaucomatous neuronal death occurs in the retina optic nerve lateral geniculate nucleus and visual SC but the optic nerve headespecially the lc is considered to be the primary site of axonal injury evaluation of the lc structure may greatly enhance glaucoma diagnostics and our understanding of its pathophysiology however only a small portion of the lc is clinically seen through the thin prelaminar neural tissue in the CE area of the optic disc the lc is mostly obscured by the neuroretinal rim in the NVD region and by the sclera choroid RPE in the parapapillary region with enhanced depth imaging OCT different mechanisms of laminar deformation in glaucoma can be demonstrated and a new structurestructurefunction rho developed
GA,golgi apparatus,TS-3591,the tumour suppressor functions of p that are important for its activity depend on its role as a Tc arrest mediator and apoptosis inducer here we identify a novel CF for p in regulating cell morphology and movement we investigated the overall effect of p on morphological changes induced by rhoa rac and cdc gtpases in mouse embryonic fibroblasts mefs interestingly p exerted a selective effect on cdcmediated cell functions i both overexpression of wildtype p and activation of endogenous p counteracted cdcinduced filopodia formation conversely pdeficient mefs exhibited constitutive membrane filopodia mechanistic studies indicate that p prevents the initiating steps of filopodia formation downstream of cdc ii over expression of p modulates cell spreading of mefs on fibronectin iii during cell migration the reorientation of the GA in the direction of movement is abolished by wildtype p expression thus preventing cell polarity our data demonstrate a previously uncharacterized role for p in regulating cdcdependent cell effects that control actin CSK dynamics and cell movement this novel function may contribute to p antitumour activity
CFA,confirmatory factor analyses,TS-3592,the penn state worry questionnaire pswq is a widely used self report scale to assess pathological worry several studies have shown that the paperandpencil version of the pswq shows satisfactory psychometric properties yet it is unknown whether the pswq is suited to be administered on internet as the amount of assessments conducted online is vastly increasing we examined the factor structure predictive validity and reliability of the online version of the pswq in a large community sample n CFA demonstrated that the best fit to the data was provided by a one factor model wherein the reverseworded items also loaded on a separate method factor in a second part of the study a selfselected subsample of the total sample n kept a log of the frequency and duration of worry episodes for six consecutive days worry frequency and worry duration were both predicted by the pswq thereby lending support to its predictive validity these findings provide preliminary evidence that the online version of the he hipvs than by the individual EDC composing the blend crop type however had a strong impact on the strength of arthropod responses to hipvs a few arthropod species were broadly affected across both crops ie the herbivore halticus bractatus was repelled by most of our treatments regardless of crop background but overall more arthropod CG responded to hipvs released in soybean fields compared with corn this was true despite the fact that taxa responding to hipvs were present and abundant in both systems suggesting that cropbased outcomes were likely driven by the plant matrix rather than mere differences in taxonomic composition of the arthropod community in corn vs soybean fields as a whole these results suggest that i repellent effects of hipvs on natural enemies of herbivorous insects can be observed as frequently as attractive effects ii odor blends may be no more effective than singlecompound lures for some taxa and iii crop BG alters the magnitude of attraction to hipvs depending on the species being targeted
IC,infection control,TS-3593,the microorganisms causing nosocomial infections belong either to the patient himself endogenous infections or to hospital flora new epidemiological tools using molecular technologies have renewed the body of knowledge on this flora the commonest pathogens producing nosocomial infections include coagulase positive or negative staphylococci enterococci enterobacteriaceae pseudomonas and candida a recent trend has been shown indicating the emergence of gram positive cocci and fungi when e coli and klebsiella tend to decrease bacterial resistance to antimicrobials is a growing concern with the appearance of new resistance mechanisms such as broadspectrum betalactamases in gram negative rods vancomycin resistance in several gram positive species or multiply resistance in enterococci staphylococci pseudomonas or mycobacteria some pathogens create new concerns nowadays such as m tuberculosis m avium intracellulare gram positive bacilli exemplified by corynebacterium jk water bacteria nonalbicans candida and other fungi increasing therapeutic challenge underlines the prominent role of IC programs
SCCs,squamous cell cancers,TS-3594,second HM are a rare but welldefined late complication after autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantation sct solid HM occur in up to of patients years T3 sct with myeloablative conditioning with no plateau in the incidence rates they are responsible for of late deaths T3 sct the incidence is increased with T3 age at sct the L1 risk AF are the use of TB irradiation which is associated with adenocarcinomas and with chronic graftversushost disease which is associated with SCCs there is less data on the incidence of second malignancies after reducedintensity conditioning but it may not be lower the types of solid tumors reported in excess include melanoma and other skin cancers cancers of the oral cavity and head and neck brain CL uterine cervix thyroid breast lung and possibly gastrointestinal cancers therapyrelated myeloid neoplasms tmn are more common T3 autologous sct and may be related mostly to pretransplant therapies posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease is donorcellderived lymphoma that is more common T3 allogeneic sct with tcell SD or intensive immunesuppression state second HM are most often treated similarly to the ST for similar malignancies lifelong cancer screening and prevention interventions are required for all transplantation survivors
SED,spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia,TS-3595,spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda sedt an xlinked recessive skeletal disorder presents with disproportionate SS and barrelchest deformity in affected hemizygous adolescent boys in four reported families to date mutations in a gene designated sedl SED late cosegregate with sedt we diagnosed sedt in a shortstature kyphotic yearold boy because of his characteristic vertebral malformations clinical manifestations of sedt were evident in at least four previous generations a novel base pair bp deletion in exon of sedl was found in the propositus by PCR reaction pcr amplification and sequencing of all four coding exons the mutation atdel cosegregated with the kindreds skeletal disease the deletion is adjacent to a noncanonical splice site for exon but does not alter splicing instead it deletes bp from the coding CS causing a frameshift a maternal aunt and her three young sons were investigated subsequently radiographs showed subtle shaping CA of her pelvis and knees suggesting heterozygosity xrays of the spine and pelvis of her yearold son revealed characteristic changes of sedt but her younger sons aged years and years showed no abnormalities sedl analysis confirmed that she and only her eldest boy had the bp deletion molecular testing of sedl enables carrier PCD and definitive diagnosis before clinical or radiographic expression of sedt although there is no specific treatment for sedt preexpression molecular testing of sedl could be helpful if avoiding PCS activities potentially injurious to the spine and the joints proves beneficial
FP,pgf alpha,TS-3596,we investigated differences in maternal plasma and trophoblast prostaglandin metabolism associated with preterm births tissue prostaglandins pgs e and f alpha and the stable plasma pgf alpha metabolite dihydroketopgf alpha were measured in PT weeks and term or weeks births amnion pge in preterm ngg wet weight tissue x sem n was lower than in term ngg wet weight x sem n p placenta pge was lower in PT ngg wet weight x sem than in term ngg wet weight x sem p preterm FP was consistently lower in the amnion ngg wet weight and placenta ngg wet weight than in term amnion ngg wet weight p and placenta ngg wet weight p chorionic pge and plasma pgf alpha metabolite followed this trend but did not reach significance these findings suggest qualitative and quantitative differences in maternal and trophoblast eicosanoid metabolism between term and preterm parturition
CI,constraintinduced,TS-3597,T3 moderate intracerebral hemorrhage ich both hypothermia hypo and CI movement therapy cimt improve REC and reduce the volume of BB injury we tested the hypothesis that more severe ich requires both cytoprotection and rehabilitation to significantly improve REC rats were subjected to a unilateral striatal ich via MMP-8 infusion rats remained normothermic or were subjected to mild hypo approximately days starting h later fourteen days after ich half of the rats received cimt days of restraint of the less affected limb plus daily exercises the remainder were untreated walking limb use and skilled reaching were assessed up to days at which time animals were euthanized and the volume of tissue lost was determined the hypo treatment alone did not improve outcome whereas cimt alone provided significant benefit on the limb use asymmetry test in the staircase test the greatest benefit was achieved with the combination of hypo and cimt treatments the volume of tissue lost after ich was similar among groups arguing against cytoprotection as a mechanism of PET recovery finally these findings suggest that at least under the present circumstances eg severe striatal ich cimt provides superior benefit to hypo and that combination therapy will sometimes further improve recovery
AT,ambient temperature,TS-3598,hydrostatic pressure causes a monophasic decrease in the c primary isotope effect expressed on the oxidation of BA by yeast alcohol dehydrogenase the primary isotope effect was measured by the competitive method using wholemolecule mass spectrometry the effect is therefore an expression of isotopic discrimination on the kinetic parameter vk which measures substrate capture moderate pressure increases capture by activating hydride transfer the TS of which must therefore have a smaller volume than the free alcohol plus the capturing form of enzyme cho yk northrop d b biochemistry the decrease in the c isotope effect with increasing pressure means that the TS for hydride transfer from the heavy atom must have an even smaller volume measured here to be mlmol the pressure data factor the kinetic isotope effect into a semiclassical reactantstate component with a null value of kk and a transitionstate component of qq borrowing bells nomenclature for hydrogen tunneling corrections a similar experiment involving a deuterium isotope effect previously returned the same volume and null value plus a pressuresensitive isotope effect northrop d b cho yk biochemistry consistent with precedence in the chemical literature the latter suggested a possibility of hydrogen tunneling however it is unlikely that carbon can engage in significant tunneling at AT the fact that the decrease in activation volumes for hydride transfer is equivalent when one mass unit is added to the carbon end of a scissile ch bond and when one mass unit is added to the hydrogen end is significant and suggests a common origin
BC,body composition,TS-3599,dehydroepiandrosterone dhea the most abundant sex steroid is primarily secreted by the adrenal gland and a F0 hormone used by athletes for performance enhancement wholebody vibration wbv is a wellknown lightresistance exercise by automatic adaptations to rapid and repeated oscillations from a vibrating platform which is also a simple and convenient exercise for older adults however the potential effects of dhea supplementation combined with wbv training on to BC exercise performance and hormone regulation are currently unclear the objective of the T0 is to investigate the effects of dhea supplementation combined with wbv training on BC exercise performance and PCS fatiguerelated biochemical responses and testosterone content in youngadult B6 mice in this study male B6 mice were divided into four groups n per group for weeks treatment sedentary controls with vehicle sc systemic inflammation mo is rare in the GA dog population however some breeds weimaraner great dane and irish setter have a much higher incidence supporting a hereditary etiology autoinflammatory childhood disorders of parallel presentation such as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis crmo and deficiency of interleukin receptor antagonist dira involve impaired innate immunity pathways and aberrant cytokine production given the similarities between these diseases we hypothesize that mo is an autoinflammatory disease mediated by cytokines involved in innate immunity to characterize immune dysregulation in mo dogs we measured serum C2 of inflammatory markers in mo and control dogs mo dogs had significantly higher levels pgml of serum interleukinbeta ilÎ² il il rGM-CSF gmcsf cxc motif chemokine cxcl RT CN factor tnf and il notably recovered mo dogs were not different from dogs during AS mo disease providing a suggestive mechanism for disease predisposition this is the first documentation of elevated immune markers in mo dogs uncovering an immune profile similar to comparable autoinflammatory disorders in children
PE,plasma epinephrine,TS-3600,plasma catecholamine levels increase dramatically at birth to determine the contribution of adrenal catecholamine secretion to the surge in catecholamines at birth and the role in newborn adaptation we performed surgical ADX or sham T0 on nearterm ovine fetuses T3 REC in utero the animals were delivered and supported by mechanical ventilation plasma catecholamine levels HR rate blood pressure cardiac output pulmonary CF surfactant secretion and PR of free fatty acids ffa and glucose were compared in control and adrenalectomized animals PE increased rapidly at birth in controls but was undetectable in adrenalectomized animals NE were not statistically different heart rate blood pressure cardiac SO and contractility increased abruptly after cord cutting in controls but did not increase in adrenalectomized animals lung compliance pulmonary CF surfactant pool size gl and ffa levels were significantly decreased in adrenalectomized animals these results suggest that adrenal epinephrine secretion is vital to many of the adaptive events at birth
SC,subtilisin carlsberg,TS-3601,with the aim to distinguish between local and global conformational changes induced by trifluoroethanol in rnase a spectroscopic and activity measurements in combination with proteolysis by unspecific PRs have been exploited for probing structural transitions of rnase a as a CF of trifluoroethanol concentration at vv trifluoroethanol ph degrees c circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy indicate a cooperative collapse of the tertiary structure of rnase a coinciding with the loss of its enzymatic activity in contrast to the denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride urea or temperature the breakdown of the tertiary structure in trifluoroethanol is accompanied by an induction of AA structure as detected by faruv circular dichroism spectroscopy proteolysis with the nonspecific PRs SC or PK both of which attack native rnase a at the alaser peptide bond yields refined information on conformational changes particularly in the pretransition region while trifluoroethanol at concentrations results in a strong increase of the rate of proteolysis and new primary cleavage CS tyrser metser were identified the rate of proteolysis at trifluoroethanol concentrations vv is much smaller up to two orders of magnitude than that of the native rnase a the proteolysis data point to a decreased flexibility in the surrounding of the alaser peptide bond which we attribute to subtle conformational changes of the ribonuclease a molecule these changes however are too marginal to alter the overall catalytic and spectroscopic properties of ribonuclease a
RA,regional anesthesia,TS-3602,in recent years increasing attention has been focused on the treatment of acute and chronic pain with a considerable number of publications about it nevertheless all the attention focused on it the evidence of pain treatments is still unfolding and occasionally conflicting hence it is still necessary that we point out our research efforts in trying to obtain a better understand of pathophysiology of pain and of real tau and safety of acute and chronic pain treatments our goal with this review is to summarize the latest research trends and the most T3 therapeutic standards for pain syndromes described in the literature the discussion will be divided in four main topics as these topics were treated during the simpar study in multidisciplinary pain research meeting held on december in pavia pathophysiology of pain acute postoperative pain opioids and pain and chronic pain failed back surgery syndrome in the chapter of pathophysiology of pain we analyzed how to obtain a more personalized treatment through the T0 of the genetic and neurophysiological characteristics of patients and how to select the RA local anesthetic according to anatomic and metabolizing patterns of patients in acute postoperative pain we focalized our attention on the evidence supporting the use of continuous PN blocks in the treatment of postoperative pain and in the prevention of chronic persistent postoperative pain with a special attention in preventing SE of RA we also reviewed the current evidence about the use of new very interesting modality to control postoperative pain after LS preemptive nebulization of local anesthetic in abdominal cavity as opioids are currently widely used to control chronic oncologic and nononcologic pain in this review we analyzed the level of evidence for their use how to manage them better and psychological factors that can affect their success andor determine addiction finally we summarized the current evidence about failed back surgery syndrome focalizing our attention both in diagnosing it correctly and treating this syndrome with TPS knowledge of the anatomic space that we have to RPA and applying the possible treatments depending on pain pathophysiology and patient characteristics in conclusion it is important to try to personalize even better the therapy of patients with acute and chronic pain through a more accurate knowledge of anatomy pathophysiology of pain pharmacokinetic of pain drugs and of new devicetherapies available
RR,relative risk of death,TS-3603,to optimize the prognostic value of dna flow cytometry in breast cancer the authors calculated several parameters from the dna histogram including the dna index the size and number of aneuploid peaks as well as sphase and gmphase Tc fractions of these dna index and sphase fraction spf proved to be the most valuable prognostic indices dna aneuploidy was associated with a threefold risk of death as compared to dna diploidy p less than the highest risk of death was associated with hypertetraploid greater than dna index whereas a tetraploid dna index was associated with a relatively low risk the spf had significant additional prognostic value in both dna 2C p and dna AN p PT by combining DI and spf the authors defined three types of dna histograms which were associated with favorable intermediate and poor prognosis of the patients dna diploidy together with low less than spf type i dna histogram was associated with very favorable prognosis whereas dna aneuploidy with high DI greater than or high greater than spf type iii dna histogram was related to the worst prognosis with approximately eightfold RR in a cox multivariate SRA the type of dna histogram was an independent and most powerful prognostic indicator in breast CA the other independent AF in the cox analysis were primary RT size nodal status and progesterone receptor status
PCA,passive cutaneous anaphylaxis,TS-3604,the ability of ampicillin polymers to elicit PCA pca reactions in guinea pigs was analyzed mediating antibodies were raised in rabbits against a crude preparation of aminopenicillanic acid apa it was found that large ampicillin polymers were potent elicitors fold better than benzylpenicillin polymers small polymers in high concentrations did not elicit pca reactions but inhibited the activity of the larger polymers this inhibition was more pronounced that that of ampicillin monomer high molecular weight of ampicillin polymer in the amount of in an ampicillin solution manifested its pca activity the tendency of ampicillin to polymerize particularly when kept in solution makes this observation worth considering the pca reactions described were penicilloylspecific as verified by immunosorbent experiments
SE,shannon entropy,TS-3605,we investigate postural sway data dynamics in older adult fallers and nonfallers center of pressure cop signals were recorded during quiet standing in older adults the subjects were divided in two groups with and without PH of falls cop time series were analyzed using recurrence quantification analysis rqa in both anteroposterior and mediolateral ml directions classical stabilometric variables path length and range were also computed the results showed that rqa outputs quantifying predictability of cop fluctuations and SE of recurrence plot diagonal L1 length CSD were significantly higher in fallers only for ml direction in addition the range of ml cop signals was also significantly higher in fallers this result is in accordance with some findings of the literature and could be interpreted as an increased hip strategy in fallers the rqa results seem coherent with the theory of loss of complexity with aging and disease our results suggest that rqa is a promising approach for the investigation of cop fluctuations in a frail population
NP,neuropsychological,TS-3606,the assessment of effort is an important aspect of a comprehensive NP DUE as this can significantly impact data interpretation while recent work has validated the appropriateness of adultderived cutoffs for standalone effort measures in younger populations little research has focused on embedded effort measures in children the present T0 includes clinically referred children and adolescents males females aged with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy reliable digit spans rdss were calculated and the test of memory malingering tomm was administered in the context of a comprehensive neuropsychological DUE using a previously published rds cutoff of â\x89¤ a pass rate of only was obtained well below the recommended pass rate for an ERP effort index in contrast when adult criteria were used on tomm trial a pass rate was observed rds scores were significantly correlated with iq estimates r p and age r p the difference between rds and the tomm on the participant outcome was statistically significant Ï\x87 p these results suggest that rds appears to yield a C1 number of false positives and therefore may be of limited utility in detecting poor effort in a pediatric epilepsy population these findings likely extend to other pediatric populations that are known to have significant cognitive loss
AS,asparagine synthetase,TS-3607,in the absence of crystallographic data the mechanism of nitrogen transfer from glutamine in AS as remains under active investigation surprisingly the glutaminedependent as from escherichia coli asnb appears to lack a conserved histidine residue necessary for nitrogen transfer if the reaction proceeds by the accepted pathway in other glutamine amidotransferases but retains the ability to synthesize asparagine we propose an alternative mechanism for nitrogen transfer in asnb which obviates the requirement for participation of histidine in this step our hypothesis may also be more generally applicable to other glutaminedependent amidotransferases
LP,lymphocyte predominance,TS-3608,cases of hodgkins disease were found in a revision of the CL node biopsies studied between and at the institute of pathology of the buenos aires medical school using ryes nomenclature were classified as LP as NS as MC and as lymphocyte depletion type of HD disease preservation of various lymph node structures was observed in of the cases and was more common in the less aggressive varieties of HD disease such as LP and NS the differences were statistically significant p less than for the preservation of the medullary sinus and capsule of the CL node the presence of sarcoidlike granulomas was more frequent in the LP type and foam cell Az with touton giant cells were seen only in cases of nodular sclerosing hodgkins disease vein invasion was present only in mixed cellularity and lymphocyte SD hodgkins disease
PN,pontine nucleus,TS-3609,the anatomical connections of the dorsolateral PN dlpn implicate it in the production of smoothpursuit eye movements it receives inputs from cortical structures believed to be involved in visual motion processing middle temporal SC or motion execution PPC and projects to the flocculus of the cerebellum which is involved in smooth pursuit to determine the role of the dlpn in SP we have studied the discharge patterns of dlpn SN in five monkeys trained to make smoothpursuit eye movements of a spot moving either across a patterned background or in darkness four unit types could be distinguished visual units discharged in response to movement of a C1 textured DP often in a directionselective fashion but not during smooth pursuit of a spot in the dark eye movement SN discharged during sinusoidal smooth pursuit in the dark with peak discharge rate either at peak eye position or peak eye velocity but they showed no response during BG movement or during other visual stimulation these units continued to discharge when the target was extinguished blanked briefly and the monkey continued to make smooth eye movements in the dark the majority of our dlpn units discharged during both SP in the dark and background movement while the monkey fixated blanking the target during smooth pursuit revealed that these units fell into two distinct classes visual pursuit units ceased discharging during a blank suggesting that they had only a visual sensitivity pursuit and visual units continued to discharge during the blank indicating that they had a combined oculomotor and visual sensitivity ninetyfive percent of the units that discharged during SP were direction selective these units had rather broad directional TCs with widths at half height ranging from to degrees many preferred directions for dlpn units were observed although the vertical and nearvertical directions predominated most units that responded to largefield BG movement were direction selective during sinusoidal movement of a largefield background half of them also discharged in relation to CS- velocity whereas others did not
MA,metabolic acidosis,TS-3610,to determine whether the regulation of BB ECF acidbase balance is by AS ion transport or passive distribution changes in cisternal and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid csf h and hco minus were assessed in five dogs with normal acidbase status and in six dogs during MA both CG were MV to maintain a constant paco the ph pco hco minus and lactate in csf and arterial plasma and the csfplasma dc potential difference were determined at intervals and the EC potential differnces mu for h and hco minus were calculated following control measurements at pha equal to MA was induced by infusion of n hcl measurements were made and h thereafter and at and h in the control series a steady state for ion distribution was reached by h in the control series at h the values of mu for h and hco minus were within minus and mv of initial values at the cistern and and mv at the lumbar site during MA the h values at the cistern returned to and mv of control for muh and muhco minus while lumbar values returned to and minus mv the closeness of these h values of mu to control is compatible with passive CSD of h and hco minus between csf and blood
CF,conventional fractionation,TS-3611,a randomized phase iii T0 was started in japan to demonstrate the noninferiority of survival of accelerated fractionation radiation therapy gyfr with CF radiation therapy gyfr in patients with tnm glottic cancer this T0 began in september and a total of patients will be accrued from institutions within years the primary endpoint is year PFS survival pfs the AA endpoints are overall survival local PFS survival diseasefree survival survival with preserved voice function CR proportion of treatment completion and AEs
AR,airway responsiveness,TS-3612,we studied the effect of adenosine on airway CR of isolated canine bronchial smooth muscle under ISO conditions in vitro administration of adenosine and its analogs increased the contractile responses of bronchial segments to EFS in a dosedependent fashion where the rank order potency was NECA greater than adenosine greater than ncyclohexyladenosine but had no effect on those to exogenous acetylcholine this potentiation was more pronounced at relatively low than at high CS- frequencies the maximal increase from the baseline responses being at hz mean se p less than adenosine also increased the histamineinduced contraction causing a leftward shift of the histamine DRCs an effect that was abolished in the presence of atropine these results suggest that adenosine potentiates AR to vagal stimulation and to histamine through the activation of prejunctional a receptor probably involving the accelerated release of acetylcholine from the cholinergic nerve terminals
CL,contralateral,TS-3613,the morphology distribution and quantitation of dendritic langerhans cells lc was determined by analysis of adpase stained epithelial flat mounts from week young adult resistant and month old susceptible aged mice before and after exp infection with p aeruginosa topically applied to the scarified cornea the CL eye controls was also scarified and phosphate buffered saline applied similarly this T0 has examined the changes in adpase positive cell populations of the conjunctival limbal epithelium and corneal epithelium of naturally resistant mice swisswebster and cdf following corneal infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa at two different ages young AD week old and aged month old the young adult mice recover from their infection and restore corneal clarity while the aged mice have extensive ocular destruction and corneal scarring conjunctival limbal dendritic cell numbers in young AD mice were found to be significantly increased at day seven post infection and then returned to baseline C2 in contrast conjunctival limbal dendritic cell numbers in aged mice were found to increase slowly and to peak at fourteen days T3 infection other differences between the two ages young adult and aged included an initial increase in dendritic cells five hours post infection in the young adult groups and an initial decrease at five hours in the aged groups of mice
NE,net energy,TS-3614,crude glycerol a byproduct of biodiesel production has gained significant attention as a carbon source for biofuel production this T0 evaluated the SE balance of biodiesel hydrogen biogas and ethanol production from million l of crude glycerol wv the conversion efficiency energy output divided by SE invested was and for the production of biodiesel hydrogen biogas and ethanol respectively it was found that the use of crude glycerol for biodiesel production was an SE gain process with a positive energy balance and conversion efficiency of greater than the energy balance revealed a NE gain of gj per million kg biodiesel produced production of hydrogen biogas and ethanol from crude glycerol were SE loss processes therefore the conversion of crude glycerol to lipids and subsequently to biodiesel is suggested to be a better option compared to hydrogen biogas or ethanol production with respect to EB
CS,clinical score,TS-3615,fifty nine asthmatic children and adolescents clinically stable aged to years boys and girls from instituto da crianÃ§a do hospital das clÃ\xadnicas da fmusp were studied from september to november the patients were classified by the CS of the international consensus for asthma diagnosis and management they performed baseline spirometry and peak expiratory PFR pefr before and after bronchodilator and measured pefr three times a day pm at HS and on waking for one day at home five pef measurements were made serially and the best readings were considered variability of pfe was calculated for hours as assessed by MA the results were summited to statistical analysis of the laboratorio de informÃ¡tica mÃ©dica da faculdade de medicina da usp the results of pefr and its variability were compared to spirometry PET score fevforced expiratory volume in the first second and to the CS of the international consensus for asthma diagnosis and management in case of disagreement between the clinical parameters the more severe one was chosen the clinical score classified of our patients as mild obstruction as moderate and as severely compromised according to fev of patients were classified as normal while the pefr and its variability classified as normal and the pefr and its variability in hours correlated with the vef as gold standard showed good specificity and respectively and low sensibility and it was detected a low level of PA between fev pefr and its variability in hours in the clinical severity classification of asthma the results of this study showed that fev and pefr had a low level of PA in the clinical severity classification of asthma and when they were correlated to the CS of the international consensus they both presented low sensitivity
CE,central,TS-3616,pyruvate phosphate dikinase ppdk reversibly catalyzes the conversion of atp phosphate and Pyr into amp pyrophosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate pep respectively since the nucleotide IB site in the NTD and the pyruvatepep binding site in the CTD are separated by approximately a it has been proposed that an intermediary domain called the central domain swivels between these remote domains to transfer the phosphate however no direct structural evidence for the swiveling CE domain has been found in this T0 the crystal structures of maize ppdk with and without pep have been determined at a resolution these structures revealed that the central domain is located near the pyruvatepep IB CTD in contrast to the ppdk from clostridium symbiosum wherein the CE domain is located near the nucleotidebinding NTD structural comparisons between the maize and c symbiosum ppdks demonstrated that the swiveling motion of the CE domain consists of a rotation of at least degrees and a translation of a by comparing the maize ppdk structures with and without pep we have elucidated the mode of binding of pep to the CT domain and the induced conformational changes in the CE domain
ET,essential thrombocythemia,TS-3617,MMM is a hematologic disorder currently classified with polycythemia vera and ET as a chronic myeloproliferative disease the median age at diagnosis is years and more than of patients are diagnosed after age years clinical manifestations include massive splenomegaly progressive anemia profound constitutional symptoms and extramedullary hematopoiesis the diagnosis is confirmed by bone marrow examination after other causes of myelofibrosis are ruled out median survival is years and causes of death include leukemic transformation prognosis is adversely affected by the presence of anemia hemoglobin gdl leukopenia or leukocytosis WG blood cells micro l circulating blasts and hypercatabolic symptoms conventional treatment is palliative and does not improve survival in this regard androgen S9 CSs and erythropoietin are useful for the treatment of diseaseassociated anemia symptomereas the complex found between and h is less stable
VR,ventral root,TS-3618,the location of the b bradykinin receptors involved in inflammatory hyperalgesia was investigated no TPS IB of the b BK receptor ligand hdesargkallidin was detected in primary cultures of rat dorsal root ganglion neurones even T3 treatment with interleukin beta iu ml in dorsal root ganglion neurones activation of b bradykinin receptors stimulated polyphosphoinositidase c in contrast b BK receptor agonists desargbradykinin up to microm and desargkallidin up to microm failed to activate polyphosphoinositidase c even in neurones that had been treated with interleukin beta iu ml prostaglandin e microm or prostaglandin i microm DRG neurones removed from rats both neonatal and days old that had been pretreated with inflammatory mediators freunds CR adjuvant or carrageenan failed to respond to b BK receptor selective agonists desargbradykinin up to microm and desargkallidin up to microm bradykinin nm to nm evoked VR responses when applied to IP receptive fields or CE terminals of primary afferents in the neonatal rat spinal cord and tail preparation in contrast desargbradykinin nm to nm failed to evoke VR depolarizations in either control rats or in animals that developed inflammation following ultraviolet irradiation of the tail skin the results of the present study imply that the b bradykinin receptors that contribute to hypersensitivity in models of persistent inflammatory hyperalgesia are located on cells other than sensory neurones where they may be responsible for releasing mediators that sensitize or activate the nociceptors
HS,bedtime,TS-3619,the present T0 surveyed the sleep habits of yearold children in asahikawa city using questionnaires completed by a parent during childrens medical checkups questionnaires were collected from the parents of children males females mean age years enrolled in this survey among these children the mean bedtime was pm with children going to bed T3 pm on the other hand the mean wakeup time was am with children waking up after am the mean nocturnal sleep duration was hours nocturnal sleep durations in children that went to bed after pm were significantly shorter than in children who went to bed earlier p seventythree percent of the children had a daily afternoon nap twelve percent of these children usually awoke from their nap after pm and the mean HS for these children was pm a late HS was significantly correlated with parental complaints such as shorttemper and poor appetite p although parents were concerned about nighttime sleep conditions they were not concerned about the daytime conditions which regulate childrens sleepwake rhythm such as daylight SE daytime activity and naps while of parents had complains regarding their childrens sleep only had consulted with a doctor similar to the previous reports the present findings demonstrate that children in asahikawa city go to bed late and have decreased sleep duration since the establishment of a normal sleepwake rhythm is essential for both PCS and mental OD in children it is necessary to educate parents regarding the importance of childrens sleep
AD,apparent digestibility,TS-3620,the hypothesis tested was that the FF of n PUFA fatty acids pufa results in more wholebody FAO than the FF of saturated fatty acids sfa it was reasoned that the increased HFA oxidation would be associated with enhanced wholebody SE expenditure and stimulated de novo fatty acid synthesis to put the hypothesis to the test broiler chickens were fed diets containing either BT as source of sfa or an oil blend as source of n pufa the broilers either had free access to their diet or were fed a restricted amount sevendayold male broiler chickens were used they were kept individually in cages from to weeks of age in the birds fed ad libitum the n pufa diet reduced average DFI adfi but did not significantly affect average daily WG adg and the feedconversion ratio fcr the lower adfi on the n pufa diet was associated with a higher AD of total fatty acids the ratio of deposition in the body to intake of digestible total pufa which reflected n pufa was significantly decreased by the n pufa diet pointing at preferentially increased n pufa oxidation on the n pufa diet the ratio for n monounsaturated fatty acids mufa was higher than which agrees with net de novo synthesis but the n pufa diet induced a lower value than did the sfa diet FF either the n pufa or sfa diet did not influence SE expenditure expressed as percentage of energy intake this study supports the idea that dietary n pufa instead of sfa are preferentially oxidized but no proof was obtained for enhanced SE expenditure and contrary to the hypothesis put forward the n pufa diet depressed denovo fatty FAS
RT,reactive thrombocytosis,TS-3621,in order to evaluate the natural history of essential thrombocythaemia et clinical data and prognostic factors of patients with et were retrospectively analysed mean observation time years in patients the early phase of the disease with initial PLT counts between and x l was assessed in most early cases et was suggested by clinical symptoms and increased megakaryopoiesis with abnormal megakaryocytes in bone marrow histology n and cytology n other myeloproliferative disorders and RT were excluded according to the diagnostic criteria of the polycythemia vera T0 group during followup of the early cases not treated cytoreductively at diagnosis the platelet counts increased to x l in patients and remained between and x l in patients in primarily asymptomatic patients n with initial PLT counts above n and below x l n the rates of increase of symptomatic patients were similar at about per year no influence of the initial PLT count on survival was seen in multivariate analysis of prognostic AF which included all cases survival was mainly influenced by the rate of etrelated complications during followup p analysing the influence of cytoreductive therapy on symptomfree survival PLT reduction benefited patients under years cytoreductively treated v UT patients p the results demonstrate the possible clinical relevance of the early stages of et and suggest that the features of pathologic megakaryopoiesis in the bone marrow are a more reliable diagnostic criterion than a definite PLT limit therefore further therapeutic studies should include all stages of the disease and all age groups
SE,salmonella enteritidis,TS-3622,efficient adjuvants have the potential to trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses simultaneously flagellin is a unique pathogenderived protein which is recognized by PRR prrs as well as by bcell and t cell receptors thus providing an important link between innate and adaptive immunity the aforementioned properties define flagellin as an optimal adjuvant the induction of immunogenic cell death could be an additional expectation for adjuvants in the context of CA immunotherapy due to their ability to activate dendritic cells dc to present RT antigens through the engulfment of dying cells the immunostimulatory potential of flagellin in the course of dc and lymphocyte activation is well documented however the exact mechanism is not fully explored based on this limitation we sought to investigate the potential modulatory effects of flagellin on various cell death processes knowing that it plays detrimental roles in regulating the final outcome of various types of immune responses here we provide evidence that the i.c.v. of jurkat tcells with recombinant flagellin is able to increase the degree of cell death provoked by fasl or tnfÎ± and concomitantly increases the cytotoxic potential of phytohemagglutinin activated tlymphocytes in a tlr dependent way in contrast to these flagellinmediated effects on the death receptorinduced signaling events the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway remained unaffected furthermore the CC supernatant of wild type SE bacteria but not their flagellin deficient variant was able to enhance the fasinduced cell death process to define the molecular mechanisms of flagellinmediated elevated levels of cell death we were able to detect the upregulation of ripdependent signaling events these findings demonstrate that the cooperative actions of DP recognition and different death receptors are able to initiate the cell death process with the mobilization of ripdependent cell death modalities this finding highlights the capability of flagellin to act as a potential adjuvant which is relevant for RT immunotherapy
CAA,cerebral amyloid angiopathy,TS-3623,CAA caa the accumulation of Î²amyloid aÎ² peptides in the walls of cerebral blood vessels is observed in the majority of alzheimers disease ad brains and is thought to be due to a failure of the aging BB to clear aÎ² perivascular drainage of aÎ² along cerebrovascular basement membranes cvbms is one of the mechanisms by which aÎ² is removed from the brain cvbms are specialized sheets of EM that provide structural and functional support for cerebral blood vessels changes in cvbm composition and structure are observed in the aged and ad brain and may contribute to the OD and progression of caa this review summarizes the properties of the cvbm its role in mediating clearance of interstitial fluids and solutes from the BB and evidence supporting a role for cvbm in the etiology of caa

EP,enzootic pneumonia,TS-3652,the effects of EP on average daily WG and number of days taken to reach slaughter weight was studied in baconweight pigs each of lung volume affected by enzootic pneumonia was shown to reduce average daily gain by grams and increase the numbers of days to slaughter by days the cost of these reductions in performance was calculated to be about nzd for each of lung affected
PF,proflavine,TS-3653,synthesis of a lanthanidebinding peptide lbp for the PCD of dsDNA is presented a PF moiety was introduced into a high affinity lbp involving two unnatural chelating amino acids in the ln ion coordination the eulbp complex is demonstrated to bind to ctdna and to sensitize eu luminescence the dna binding process is effectively detected via the eucentered luminescence thanks to the intimate coupling between the lbp scaffold and dna intercalating unit
CP,chlorpropamide,TS-3654,dimethyl sulfoxide was administered intravenously for days to twenty mice with caseininduced amyloidosis partial or total disappearance of amyloid deposits occurred in all treated animals the urine of these animals contained a substance from which amyloid fibrils could be synthesized a control group of mice with caseininduced amyloidosis given saline i.v. showed massive amyloid deposition in the liver and in the spleen at the end of the experiment neither the urine of these mice nor the urine of normal control mice treated with dimethyl sulfoxide contained substances from which amyloid fibrils could be synthesized it is our assumption that dimethyl sulfoxide treatment of mice with amyloidosis resulted in a break up of amyloid fibres into small subunits which were excreteach group and the numbers of patients satisfactorily maintained on each of the hypoglycaemic agents throughout the first year proved remarkably similar in of the successfully treated patients who were studied by crossover to the other drug and observed for a further year the mean blood glucose concentrations at the end of the year were roughly comparable but the mean weight response was a small loss of kg with metformin but a gain of kg with CP thus for nonobese maturityonset diabetics whose disease cannot be controlled by diet and who require oral treatment sulphonylureas and biguanides are equally ERP the choice depending on whether the patient is underweight and the severity of symptoms
NR,neutral red,TS-3655,cinnamomum verum is used to make the spice cinnamon and has been used as a traditional CHM we evaluated the effects and the molecular mechanisms of cuminaldehyde cua a constituent of the bark of cinnamomum verum on human lung squamous cell carcinoma ncih cells specifically cell viability was evaluated by colorimetric assay cytotoxicity by ldh PR apoptosis was determined by WB and morphological analysis with AO and NR stainings and comet CA topoisomerase i activity was assessed using CA based upon dna relaxation and topoisomerase ii by dna relaxation plus decatentation of kinetoplast dna lysosomal vacuolation and volume of acidic compartments vac were evaluated with NR staining the results show that cua suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis as indicated by an upregulation of proapoptotic bax and bak genes and a downregulation of antiapoptotic bcl and bclxl genes mitochondrial membrane potential loss cytochrome c PR activation of caspase and and morphological characteristics of apoptosis including blebbing of the plasma membrane nuclear condensation fragmentation apoptotic body formation and comet with elevated tail intensity and moment in addition cua also induced lysosomal vacuolation with increased vac cytotoxicity as well as suppressions of both topoisomerase i and ii activities in a dosedependent manner further study revealed the growthinhibitory effect of cua was also evident in a nude mice MM taken together the data suggest that the growthinhibitory effect of cua against ncih cells is accompanied by downregulations of proliferative control involving apoptosis and both topoisomerase i and ii activities and upregulation of lysosomal with increased vac and cytotoxicity similar effects were found in other cell lines including human lung adenocarcinoma a cells and CRC colo results not shown our data suggest that cua could be a potential agent for anticancer therapy
MB,myocardial bridging,TS-3656,the phasic coronary flow velocity pattern of myocardial bridging was analyzed using a inch mhz doppler guide wire coronary flow velocities and CF reserve at rest and maximum hyperemic time were measured in nine patients with MB and normal subjects systolic flow reversal followed by prominent early diastolic PV patterns was observed in seven patients in vessels with MB the systolic time velocity integral was significantly smaller in patients with MB than in normal subjects vs cm p but the diastolic time velocity integral was not significantly different however the time velocity integral throughout a cardiac cycle was significantly different between the two CG vs cm p maximum hyperemic timeaveraged peak velocity was significantly lower in patients with MB than in normal subjects vs cmsec p but there was no significant difference in coronary flow reserve between the two CG vs systolic flow reversal followed by prominent early diastolic PV patterns was observed in patients with myocardial bridging the systolic time velocity integral was significantly smaller in patients with MB so the time velocity integral throughout a cardiac cycle was significantly smaller there was no significant correlation between CFR and ratio of stenosis and coronary flow reserve was maintained
PS,pathological stage,TS-3657,clear cell renal cell carcinoma ccrcc is the most common solid lesion within kidney and its prognostic is influenced by the progression covering a complex network of gene interactions in current study the microarray data gse containing ccrcc and adjacent normal tissues was analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes on which weighted gene coexpression network analysis was performed then coexpressed gene modules were identified the highest association was found between blue module and pathological stage r by pearsons rho analysis functional enrichment analysis revealed that biological processes of blue module focused on inflammatory response immune response chemotaxis all p e in the significant module a total of network hub genes were identified fcerg exhibited the highest rho r with ccrcc progression in addition fcerg was hub node in the proteinprotein interaction network of the genes in blue module as well thus fcerg was subsequently selected for validation in the test set gse and rnasequencing data fcerg expression was also positively correlated with four stages of ccrcc progression p receiver operating characteristic roc curve indicated that fcerg could distinguish localized PS i ii from nonlocalized PS iii iv ccrcc auc p besides fcerg could be a prognostic gene in clinical practice as well revealed by survival analysis based on rnasequencing data p in conclusion using weighted gene coexpression analysis fcerg was identified and validated in association with ccrcc progression and prognosis which might improve the prognosis by influencing immunerelated pathways
BA,benzamide,TS-3658,in the present T0 the five lowest electronic states that control the uv photodissociation of formanilide and BA have been characterized using the CR active space selfconsistent field theory the mechanisms for the initial EC50 and subsequent dissociation processes have been determined on the basis of the calculated potential SE surfaces and their intersections it was found that the stt threesurface intersection plays an important role in the photodissociation processes of BA however the dissociation SMB of formanilide and benzamide was found to be quite different from that for aliphatic amides the present T0 provides several insights into the photodissociation dynamics of formanilide and BA
LM,liver metastases,TS-3659,tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase timp inhibits the proteolytic activity of several matrix MPs centrally involved in RT invasion and metastases the purpose of this T0 was to determine the origin of timp mrna production in both human CC crc and metastatic liver lesions as well as define the relationships between timp rna expression and standard clinicopathological variables of crc total cellular rna extracted from crc and LM were examined by northern blot hybridization the meannormal mucosa fold increase of timp rna was significantly elevated in both crc and LM no relationship was noted between timp expression and tumor size location nor differentiation based on CL node metastases status significantly higher timp rna levels were found in crc with metastases than in those without metastases versus p similarly timp rna C2 were higher in primary crc with distant metastases than those without distant metastases versus p in situ hybridization localized timp mrna predominantly in tumor stroma within spindle fibroblastlike cells rather than in CA cells themselves the rho between the increased timp mrna level and advanced crc stage noted in this study reflects a possible growthpromoting CF for timp in human crc
PMF,peptide mass fingerprinting,TS-3660,urokinase plasminogen activator upa is thought to exert its effects on cell growth adhesion and migration by mechanisms involving proteolysis and interaction with its cell n was applied to d page T3 coomassie brilliant blue cbb staining spots were detected and major spots were excised from the gel and subjected to ingel digestion with achromobacter protease i lysyl endopeptidase resulting peptides were analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorptionionizationtime of flightmass spectrometry malditofms followed by PMF for protein ID with this RPA we have obtained a 2DE electrophoresis de protein map in which spots were localized as landmarks for comparison of expression profiles to elucidate the basis of various biological events
CC,choledochal cyst,TS-3661,CC is a rare benign disease of the biliary tract however once diagnosed it must be excised with the gallbladder because of the risk for cancer developing in the biliary tree including the gallbladder this report introduces a new surgical technique for totally laparoscopic excision of choledochal cyst and hepaticojejunostomy using a fourhole method
SB,schiff base,TS-3662,detergent solubilized bacteriorhodopsin br proteins which contain alterations made by sitedirected mutagenesis aspasn dn aspasn dn and arggln rq have been studied with resonance RS raman spectra of the lightadapted brla and m species in dn are identical to those of native br indicating that this residue is not located near the chromophore the brla states of dn and especially rq contain more of the cis c n syn br species under ambient illumination compared to solubilized native br replacement of asp with asn causes a nm redshift of the absorption maximum and a frequency decrease in both the ethylenic cm and the SB c nh cm stretching modes of brla these changes indicate that asp is located close to the protonated retinal schiff base the brla spectrum of rq exhibits a slight perturbation of the c nh band but its m spectrum is unperturbed the raman spectra and the absorption properties of dn and rq suggest that the protein counterion environment involves the residues asp arg and presumably asp these data are consistent with a model where the strength of the proteinchromophore interaction and hence the absorption maximum depends on the overall charge of the SB counterion environment
SA,sodium alginate,TS-3663,tannase produced by paecilomyces variotii was encapsulated in SA beads and used for the ERP hydrolysis of tannic acid the efficiency of hydrolysis was comparable to that of the free enzyme the alginate beads retained of their efficiency in the first three rounds of successive use and in rounds and the response surface methodology showed that the best conditions to hydrolysis of tannic acid by immobilized tannase were sodium alginate caclâ\x82\x82 m and h to curing time the optimized process resulted in times more hydrolysed TA than that obtained before optimization the optimum ph for the actions of both the encapsulated and the free enzymes was the optimum temperature of the reaction was determined to be Â°c for the free enzyme and Â°c for the immobilized form the immobilization process improved the stability at low ph
SA,spherical aberration,TS-3664,next generation aberration correctors will not only eliminate the thirdorder SA but also improve the information limit by correction of chromatic aberration as a result of these improvements higher order aberrations which have largely been neglected in image analysis will become important in this paper we concern ourselves with situations where suba resolution can be achieved and where the thirdorder SA is corrected and the fifthorder SA is measurable we derive formulae to explore the maximum value of the fifthorder spherical aberration for directly interpretable imaging and discuss the optimum imaging conditions and their applicable range
CCR,cc chemokine receptor,TS-3665,BG CCR ccr expression is vital for cell migration to AA lymphoid organs slos our previous work showed that inducing ccr expression enabled syngeneic mesenchymal stem cells mscs to migrate into slos resulting in enhanced immunosuppressive performance in mice given that human adiposederived stem cells hascs are widely used in clinical therapy we further investigated whether upregulation of ccr enables xenogeneic hascs to migrate to rat slos material and methods hascs rarely express ccr therefore hascs were transfected with lentivirus encoding rat ccr rccr plus green fluorescence protein gfp or gfp CT ccr mrna and cell surface expression of rccrhascs and gfphascs were examined by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr and FC fcm respectively the phenotype differentiation and proliferation capacity of each cell type was also determined to examine migration rccrhascs and gfphascs were injected intravenously into Le rats and the proportion of gfppositive cells in the spleen and CL NO was determined with fcm results mrna and cell surface protein expression of ccr was essentially undetectable in hascs and gfpascs however ccr was highly expressed in rccrascs rccrhascs gfphascs and hascs shared a similar immunophenotype and maintained the ability of multilineage differentiation and proliferation in addition the average proportion of gfppositive cells was significantly higher following transplantation of rccrhascs compared with gfphascs p conclusions these results suggest that upregulation of rat ccr expression does not NC the phenotype differentiation or proliferation capacity of hascs but does enable efficient migration of hascs to rat slos
HR,hybrid resistance,TS-3666,HR which is observed in certain CS combinations when parentstrain bone marrow cells are grafted into lethally irradiated f hybrids can be specifically overcome by the iv injection wk before the VG of SP cells syngeneic with the bone marrow graft this phenomenon is due to a suppressor mechanism induced in the SP of the f hybrid by the i.t. of parentstrain SP cells and mediated by a nylonadherent thylyt cell population of hybrid origin because HR can be inhibited by the transfer into a normal bdf of nylonadherent thylyt spleen cells from bdf mice pretreated with b spleen cells wk earlier bpretreated bdf SP cells from bpretreated bdf mice not depleted of their nylonadherent subpopulation cannot restore HR when they are injected into a bdf rendered nonresistant by splitdose irradiation and spleen cells from normal bdf mice cannot restore HR when they are injected into bpretreated bdf hybrids the suppressor cells specifically inhibit resistance against bone marrow cells syngeneic with the spleen cells used for i.c.v. because transfer of nylonadherent bpretreated bdf SP cells into a normal bdf does not enhance syngeneic bdf or parentstrain d bone marrow growth and when injected into normal bdf hybrids nylonadherent spleen cells from bdf mice pretreated with d spleen cells wk earlier dpretreated bdf are not able to transfer the inhibition of HR against b bone marrow cells moreover the activity of the suppressor cells depends on the genetic environment of the hybrid host mice because nylonadherent bpretreated bdf spleen cells injected into normal bcf hybrids do not transfer an inhibition of hybrid resistance and when injected into bcf hosts previously rendered nonresistant by splitdose irradiation SP cells from bpretreated bdf mice can in contrast transfer hybrid resistance
PG,serum pepsinogen,TS-3667,in order to adopt pepsinogen C2 as a screening indicator of GC the PG i pg i and PG ii pg ii levels were studied using one thousand samples from a rural area and their ratios pg ipg ii were calculated samples were collected by stratified random sampling of the residents in s town with a population of about the collected data was statistically analyzed to determine distributions by respective categories of sex and age the following results were obtained the distributions of pg i pg ii and their ratio pg ipg ii levels largely deviated from normal distributions therefore it is recommended that nonparametrical method is used to analyze this data the median of pg i level microgramsl in males was statistically higher than that microgramsl in females on the other hand a statistically significant difference between males and females was not observed in either the pg ii value or the ratio pg ipg ii respectively the pattern for changes in pg i values with age was different between males and females while pg i levels were almost constant until the sixties T3 the seventies levels showed a marked decrease in male subjects in female subjects an age effect in C2 was not observed for pg i on the other hand pg ii C2 increased with age except for age group seventies and the pg ipg ii ratios showed a decreasing tendency in both males and females
FP,pgf alpha,TS-3668,two potent inhibitors of prostaglandin dehydrogenase pgdh ph cl a and ph ck a have been investigated for their effects on prostaglandin catabolism and synthesis in rat isolated lung both cl a microm and ck a and microm markedly increased the survival of prostaglandin e pge and FP on a single passage through the pulmonary circulation both inhibitors delayed the efflux of c following i.t. of cpge through the pulmonary circulation SO of pge and FP but not that of oxopgf alpha from exogenous AA aa was increased by cl a output of all three prostaglandins from endogenous aa stimulated by A23187 was increased by cl a with ck a output of oxopgf alpha from exogenous aa was not increased but that from endogenous aa was increased by either concentration of this inhibitor we conclude that it is possible to increase output of biologically active prostaglandins from lung by preventing their inactivation in situ the apparent selectivity of pgi synthesis from endogenous aa to potentiation by the inhibitors may have therapeutic possibilities
OCT,organic cation transporter,TS-3669,membranes from stably transfected cell lines that express two point mutations of the human OCT hoct rm and gr have been immobilized on the immobilized artificial membrane iam LC stationary phase to form two cellular membrane AC cmac columns cmachoctgr and cmachoctrm columns were created using both stationary phases and FC MSD chromatography experiments were conducted using h mmp methylphenylpyridinium as the marker ligand and various displacers including the single enantiomers of verapamil fenoterol and isoproterenol the chromatographic data obtained were used to refine a previously developed pharmacophore for hoct

SF,spotted fever,TS-3671,a case of rhabdomyosarcoma of the left atrium and left ventricle demonstrated by echocardiography was reported a yearold man was admitted to our hospital for DUE of recently developed exertional dyspnea a holosystolic murmur and a protodiastolic sound were audible at the apex a chest xray showed pulmonary congestion without cardiomegaly the 2DE echocardiogram showed a dense stratified mass of echoes occupying the medial half of the left ventricular cavity and a part of the abnormal mass of echoes was observed to move toward the left VVI outflow tract during systole another small mass attached to the anterior mitral leaflet was also observed to prolapse partly into the LA during systole the IAS showed a thick and hard band of echo in the SA view RA cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary hypertension and the levogram of the pulmonary angio years or less while the specificity of a physicians diagnosis of the rickettsial diseases appears to be high ie few cases of other diseases are misdiagnosed as either SF or mu typhus the sensitivity of the physicians diagnosis may be lower ie many cases of these diseases presenting as fevers of unknown origin are not diagnosed as rickettsial disease these findings may also be important for other countries of the region
DS,direction selectivity,TS-3672,although it is known that neural selectivity for speciesspecific vocalizations changes during development the mechanisms underlying such changes are not known this study followed the development of mechanisms underlying selectivity for the direction and rate of frequencymodulated fm sweeps in the auditory SC of the pallid bat a species that uses downward fm sweeps to echolocate in the adult SC direction and rate selectivity arise as a result of different spectral and temporal properties of lowfrequency inhibition lfi and highfrequency inhibition hfi a narrow band of delayed hfi shapes rate selectivity for downward fm sweeps a broader band of early lfi shapes direction selectivity here we asked whether these differences in lfi and hfi are present at the ON of hearing in the echolocation range or whether the differences develop slowly we also studied how the OD of properties of GABA frequencies influences fm rate and DS we found that adultlike fm rate selectivity is present at weeks T3 birth whereas direction selectivity matures weeks T3 birth the different developmental time course for direction and rate selectivity is attributable to the differences in the development of lfi and hfi arrival time and BW of hfi are adultlike at weeks average arrival time of lfi gradually becomes faster and BW becomes broader between and weeks thus two properties of fm sweeps that are important for vocalization selectivity follow different developmental time courses attributable to the differences in the OD of underlying inhibitory mechanisms
CAP,chronic alcoholic pancreatitis,TS-3673,to assess the level of oxidative AS measured as prooxidantantioxidant imbalance in the blood of patients with alcoholrelated injury of the CL and pancreas we determined superoxide ion o production by neutrophils isolated from the IP blood of groups of patients patients with compensated alcoholic CL cirrhosis n with alcoholic chronic one n and with concomitant cirrhosis and one n were included in this study all patients had consumed at least g of pure alcohol per day over years they had not abstained before admission to hospital the control group consisted of healthy nonalcoholabusive subjects as antioxidative enzymes aoe present in sera play a very important role in the regulation of plasma ROS species ros C2 and in the protection of plasma compounds against ros action we also examined the serum activity of catalase cat superoxide dismutase sod total activity and the glutathione peroxidase gpx serum concentration neutrophils of patients with concomitant alcoholic LC and one exhibited similarly to the neutrophils of patients with CAP an enhanced ability to produce superoxide anions in vitro in contrast neutrophils of patients with alcoholic LC exhibited a defect in resting and pmainduced superoxide anion production the aoe activity in the sera of patients was also significantly changed total sod activity was enhanced in all groups of patients with alcoholic LC CP and with concomitant injury of both organs cat activity was only increased in the sera of patients with LC or pancreatitis but not in the patients with concomitant cirrhosis and one gpx concentration was only diminished in the patients with chronic pancreatitis it seems likely that oxidative stress defined aimplications for the encoding of the self remain unexplored two studies examined the causal role of p x s interactionism in selfencoding on affect regulation and discriminative social perception following failure studies and and success T0 ideation participants were prompted to encode the self either in p x s interactionist terms i amwhen or in traitlike unconditional terms i am interactionist compared with unconditional selfencoding led to less affective extremity suggesting that such encoding may prevent individuals from generalizing specific success and failure experiences to the self as a whole T0 also found that interactionist selfencoding att the endorsement of global stereotypes suggesting that such encoding may enhance finegrained social perception as well
AP,alternative pathway,TS-3674,we have described the biochemical enzymatic and structural properties of a chymostatinsensitive angiotensin ang iconverting elastase found in the rat mesenteric arterial bed perfusate we determined the mrna for PE and its relative role in generating ang ii in the rat isolated aorta and carotid i.a. rings in carotid rings the ang iinduced vasoconstrictor effect was only partially inhibited by captopril or chymostatin whereas that of tetradecapeptide renin ATP tdp was greatly inhibited by chymostatin but unaffected by captopril however ang i and tdpinduced effects were abolished by the combination of both inhibitors effects of prodalaang i pda an ang iconverting enzyme aceresistant biologically inactive F0 of ang ii were blocked by chymostatin or nacetylalaalaproleuchloromethylketone elastase inhibitor in carotid artery pda failed to induce an effect in aortic rings and ang iinduced contractions were completely inhibited by captopril the mrna for rat elastase was detected in aorta carotid and MES arteries although its expression was found to be less important in aorta these findings indicate the presence of a functional AP to ace for ang ii generation in rat carotid artery and represent strong evidence of a physiological role for elastase however its functional contribution to ang ii formation in aorta appears to be negligible
ID,isotope dilution,TS-3675,the group of AA metabolites comprising the prostaglandins thromboxanes and leukotrienes eicosanoids are extremely potent biologically AS compounds their properties include proaggregatory antiaggregatory activity for platelets chemotactic activity for neutrophils vasoactive activity and contractile activity to smooth muscle in order to determine the role of these substances in pathophysiological conditions it is essential to have highly sensitive methods available for their analysisit is generally accepted that combined gas chromatographymass spectrometry is the most specific technique available for the quantitative analysis of eicosanoids however methods based on EI and positive ion chemical ionization are relatively insensitive and many investigators have preferred the use of less TPS but more sensitive methods based on radioimmunoassay we have explored the use of negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry to improve sensitivity coupled with capillary column chromatography to maximize specificityconversion of the terminal carboxyl group present in all eicosanoids to the PFB ester derivative confers excellent electron capturing properties to the molecule the derivative undergoes highly efficient thermal EC in the gas phase and any fragmentation that occurs subsequently is directed almost entirely away from the analyte molecule the stabilized carboxylate anion that results carries at least of the total ion current using selected ion monitoring techniques it is possible to detect eicosanoids in the range pg on columnthis methodology has been applied to the development of stable ID assays for plasma oxoprostaglandin pg fÎ± and for the simultaneous analysis of six biologically important pgs in biological fluids in addition stable isotope dilution techniques have been developed for the analysis of SS thromboxane b and SS leukotriene b the application of this technology to understanding the role of AA metabolism in humans will be discussed
CA,cortical area,TS-3676,fourteen infants of both sexes had a previously unreported epileptic condition characterized by nearly continuous multifocal seizures the first seizures occurred at a mean age of months without antecedent risk AF at to months the seizures became very frequent they were partial with VL clinical expression and the eeg showed that the discharges randomly involved multiple independent sites moving from one CA to another in consecutive seizures although their topography varied the eeg ictal DP of each seizure was very similar it consisted of rhythmic alpha or theta activity which spread to involve an increasing area of the cortical surface patients regressed developmentally and became quadriplegic with severe axial hypotonia three patients died at age months and at age and years respectively seizures were controlled in only patients and only children resumed psychomotor development extensive investigation failed to determine an etiology and there was no familial recurrence neuropathological examination of the BB in two cases showed only severe HPC neuronal loss and accompanying gliosis
SAC,sallyl cysteine,TS-3677,prompted by the reported hypolipidemic activity of garlic the present T0 was undertaken to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the cholesterollowering effects of garlic rat hepatocytes in primary culture were used to determine the ST effects of garlic S9 on cacetate and hglycerol incorporation into cholesterol fatty acids and glycerol lipids when compared with the control group cells treated with a high concentration of garlic extracts ie PE pef methanol mef and waterextractable wef fractions from fresh garlic showed decreased rates of cacetate incorporation into cholesterol by and into fatty acids by kyolic containing SAC and organosulfur EDC inhibited cholesterogenesis in a concentration dependent manner with a maximum inhibition of at mm at this concentration kyolic decreased cacetate incorporation into fatty acids by sallyl cysteine at and mm inhibited cholesterogenesis by pef mef and wef depressed the rates of hglycerol incorporation into triacylglycerol diacylglycerol and phospholipids in the presence of acetate but not in the presence of oleate the results suggest that the hypocholesterolemic effect of garlic stems in part from decreased hepatic cholesterogenesis whereas the triacylglycerollowering effect appears to be due to inhibition of HFA synthesis primary hepatocyte cultures as used in the present T0 have been proven useful as tools for screening the anticholesterogenic properties of garlic principles
AS,anabolic steroids,TS-3678,anabolic androgenic steroids are related to the male sex hormones and are abused in equine sports in an effort to deter the abuse of AS a sensitive lcmsms method was developed for PCD quantification and confirmation of eight major AS testosterone normethandrolone nandrolone boldenone methandrostenolone tetrahydrogestrinone thg trenbolone and ST in equine plasma formation of solvent adduct ions of the analytes was observed under ESI esi conditions and desolvation of the solvent adduct ions by source collisioninduced decomposition cid increased the abundance of the mh ions as well as the multiplereaction monitoring mrm signals esi and apci were compared with respect to sensitivity for the analytes and the former provided better sensitivity the matrix effect on ion suppression or enhancement was evaluated and was negligible confirmation of the analytes was performed using criteria of three ion transitions and lc retention time of each analyte the limit of PCD lod and quantification loq was pgml the limit of confirmation loc was pgml for boldenone pgml for normethandrolone nandrolone and methandrostenolone and pgml for testosterone thg trenbolone and stanozolol the analytes were evaluated for stability and found to be SD in plasma for h at RT days at degrees c and days at and degrees c the method was successfully applied to analyses of equine plasma samples for pharmacokinetics study this method is CS and useful for PCD quantification and confirmation of these AS in equine plasma
TF,timefrequency,TS-3679,currently eventrelated potential erp signals are analysed in the time domain erp technique or in the frequency domain fourier analysis and SCV in techniques of timedomain and frequencydomain analysis shorttime fourier transform wavelet transform assumptions concerning linearity stationarity and templates are made about the brain signals in the timefrequency component analyser tfca the assumption is that the signal has one or more components with nonoverlapping supports in the TF plane in this study the tfca technique was applied to erps tfca determined and extracted the oscillatory components from the signal and simultaneously localized them in the TF plane with high resolution and negligible crossterm contamination the results obtained by means of tfca were compared with those obtained by means of other commonly used techniques of erp analysis such as bilinear TF distributions and wavelet analysis it is suggested that tfca may serve as an AGA tool for capturing the localized erp components in the timefrequency domain and for studying the intricate frequencybased dynamics of the human BB
FA,filtered air,TS-3680,residual fluid within endoscope working channels after reprocessing may promote growth of pathogens current reprocessing guidelines therefore recommend endoscope drying with administration of forced FA however the duration and modality of administered air are not specified the new driscope aid device enables automated administration of FA at controlled pressure through all internal endoscope channels we systematically compared for the first time the impact of manual drying and automated drying on retained working channel fluid and bioburden after reprocessing
CF,cytotoxic factor,TS-3681,diabetic pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of fetal growth abnormalities which cannot be solely ascribed to fetal hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia we therefore examined the possibility of other contributing AF using rats made diabetic with streptozotocin as the experimental MM blood SS from virgin diabetic rats and to a much greater extent from Pr diabetic rats inhibited hthymidine incorporation by fetal lung cells in culture in a concentration and timedependent manner cell number was also decreased the cytotoxic activity of the SS was decreased by treatment of pregnant diabetic rats with insulin sera from nondiabetic rats and from rats at h and h after the i.t. of streptozotocin were not cytotoxic the cytotoxic activity of diabetic rat serum was retained T3 dialysis and was not destroyed by heating it for min at degrees c diabetic RS antagonized the stimulatory effects of fetal bovine serum insulin and insulinlike growth factors on thymidine incorporation by lung cells and inhibited corticosterone production by adrenal cells ultrafiltration of diabetic rat serum and highperformance gel permeation chromatography in phosphate buffer suggested that the molecular weight of the cytotoxic factor was approximately kda however gel permeation chromatography in acetonitrile of the cytotoxic eluate from RP highperformance liquid chromatography using a c and c column revealed that the CF was a low molecular weight substance which contained no amino acids the apparent discrepancy in molecular weights using different separation procedures suggests that the cytotoxic factor is bound to serum proteins the uv spectrum of this factor was different from those of ketone bodies but its exact chemical identity could not be established because of the scarcity of the material it is suggested that the sera of pregnant diabetic rats and their fetuses contain a cytotoxic factor which may contribute to fetal developmental CA
MD,methyldopa,TS-3682,endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare disease caused by hematogenic germ spread from an internal focus infections due to GBS are infrequent in adults although new cases had been described total bilirubin in serum dpd method by intralipid creatinine in serum jaffe method by cefoxitin fructosamine in SS by LD and MD uric acid in SS by levodopa MD and tetracycline carbamazepine in SS by doxycycline levodopa MD and metronidazole digitoxin in SS by rifampicin phenytoin in serum by doxycycline ibuprofen metronidazole and theophylline theophylline in SS by acetaminophen cefoxitin doxycycline levodopa phenylbutazone and rifampicin tobramycin in serum by cefoxitin doxycycline levodopa rifampicin and phenylbutazone valproic acid in SS by phenylbutazone c in SS by intralipid c in serum by doxycycline RA factor in serum by ibuprofen and metronidazole pancreatic amylase and total amylase in urine by acetylcysteine ascorbic acid cefoxitin gentamicin LD methyldopa and ofloxacin magnesium in urine by acetylcysteine gentamicin and methyldopa betamicroglobulin in urine by ascorbic acid total protein in urine by ascorbic acid cadobesilate and phenylbutazone interference in acid phosphatase creatine kinase mb and bilirubin methods was observed at very low analyte concentrations and therefore it may not be evident at higher concentrations the study confirmed the usefulness of the recommendation
AN,areca nut,TS-3683,because the mrna expression of cyclooxygenase cox is upregulated by arecoline in human GF as shown in our previous T0 we further investigated the mrna expression level of cox and its UP effectors in three oral epithelial carcinoma cell lines kb sas and ca by using AN extract ane and salivareacted ane sane a casecontrol study of oral squamous cell carcinoma oscc patients and controls was conducted to evaluate the geneenvironment interaction between cox promoter polymorphisms and substance use of alcohol BQ and cigarettes abc in risk of oscc the heterogeneous characteristics of the oral site and the cox ga polymorphism in these cell lines showed diverse inflammatory response kbcasas T3 hour anesane treatments and the cox upregulation might be mostly elicited from alternative nuclear factorkappab activation in the casecontrol study betel chewing adjusted odds ratios aor posed a much higher risk of oscc than alcohol drinking and CS aors and respectively whereas the cox aa homozygote presented a potential genetic risk or the strongest joint effect for oscc was seen in betel chewers with aa homozygote aor in the nonbetel chewing group the ag and aa genotypes together with the combined use of alcohol and cigarettes increased risk to fold and fold respectively compared with the gg genotype without substance use taken together these findings illustrate a valuable insight into the potential role of the cox promoter region in contributing to the development of betelrelated oscc including anesaneinduced transcriptional effects and enhanced joint effects of cox a S2 with substance use of abc
CM,neonatal rat cardiomyocytes,TS-3684,we previously showed that oxidative AS inhibits LIF lif signaling by targeting jak and the catalytic domains of jak and have a cysteinebased redox switch thus we postulated that the no sibling and thiophylic compound nitroxyl hno would inhibit lifinduced jakstat activation pretreatment of human microvascular EC cells hmec or CM with the hno donors angelis salt or nitrosocyclohexyl acetate nca inhibited lifinduced stat activation nca i.c.v. also blocked the induction of downstream inflammatory genes eg intercellular adhesion molecule ccaatenhancer binding protein delta the related nitrosocyclohexyl pivalate ncp not a nitroxyl donor was equally effective in inhibiting stat activation suggesting that these EDC act as thiolate targeting electrophiles the jak redox switch is likely not a target of acyloxy nitroso compounds as nca had no effect on jak catalytic activity and only modestly affected jakinduced phosphorylation of the lif receptor however pretreatment of recombinant human stat with nca or ncp reduced labeling of free sulfhydryl residues we show that ncp in the presence of diamide enhanced stat glutathionylation and dimerization in adult mouse cardiac myocytes and altered stat under nonreducing conditions finally we show that monomeric stat levels are decreased in the gÎ±q MM of heart failure in a redoxsensitive manner altogether our evidence indicates that stat has redoxsensitive cysteines that regulate its activation and are targeted by hno donors and acyloxy nitroso EDC these findings raise the possibility of new therapeutic strategies to target stat signaling via a redoxdependent manner particularly in the context of cardiac and noncardiac diseases with prominent Th1 signaling
SA,slowly adapting,TS-3685,starnosed moles have a series of mechanosensory appendages surrounding each nostril each appendage is covered with sensory organs eimers organs containing both rapidly adapting and SA mechanoreceptors and each appendage is represented in primary somatosensory SC s by a single cortical module when the skin surface of an appendage is depressed neurons in the corresponding module in s respond in either a transient or sustained fashion the aim of this study was to characterize and compare the responses of these two classes of SN to both short or ms and long ms mechanosensory stimulation activity from neurons in the representation of appendage the somatosensory fovea was recorded while delivering mechanosensory stimuli to the corresponding skin surface transient and sustained neurons had different C2 of spontaneous activity and different responses to both short and long mechanosensory stimulation neurons with sustained responses had a significantly higher spontaneous firing rate than neuroniii complexes was consistent with multiple intracellular regions that differ both in ph and csulfate both within and between specimens no systematic effect on vanadium distribution was apparent on mixing blood cells epr and xas results indicated at least three forms of endogenous vanadyl ion two of which may be dimeric an inverse linear correlation was found between soluble and complexed forms of vanadyl ion implying coregulation the epr a value of endogenous vanadyl ion ax cm was marginally different from that representing monterey bay a ceratodes a x cm comparisons indicate that bodega bay a ceratodes maintain viii in a more acidic intracellular environment on average than do those from monterey bay showing variation across populations blood cell vanadium thus noticeably diverges at all organismal C2 among a ceratodes
SI,serum iron,TS-3686,a total of people among them were men and women aged to yearspeople in the moscow region of the russian federation in the sanatorium treatment association embodiment rs fto obesity was studied using allelespecific amplification detection results in real time using taqmanprobes cDNA polymorphisms the frequency of the mutant S2 in individuals was while the tt TT was detected in of cases atin aa in men prevalence rates of obesity risk S2 a is higher than in women in individuals with obesity bmi over kgm indicated the presence of more aa genotypes compared to individuals with a body mass index of less than kgm and a VHF of occurrence versus risk S2 a compared with individuals with TT tt the examinees with the aa genotype rs fto gene was significantly higher bmi waist circumference hip circumference fat mass the same patients SE expenditure at rest value calculated per kg of lean body mass or muscle was slightly less than with tt genotype in individuals with the aa genotype rs fto gene compared with the tt genotype had significantly lower levels of hdl cholesterol and SI in the background significantly elevated concentrations of UA thus the DUE of patients with the use of innovative technologies in a spa treatment allows their personal alimentary correction for the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases
TD,typically developing,TS-3687,it has been suggested that intraindividual variability iiv in NP tasks may be a TPS characteristic of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder adhd but previous research has not thoroughly examined whether iiv also concerns academic performance or other types of DD the present study investigates the role of iiv in children with adhd without reading difficulties children with dyslexia without associated symptoms of adhd and TD children tdc in a simple response time srt task and in a skill more directly related with school learninghandwriting results show that children with adhd and those with dyslexia have a greater iiv than the tdc in both tasks however the DP of the relationship between iiv in srt and handwriting was different in children with adhd and dyslexia the iiv in the handwriting task was found to depend on iiv in the srt task only in children with dyslexia these findings support the crucial role of iiv not only in adhd but also in other DD but suggest that in children with adhd it may present specific aspects related with motor control
MV,methyl viologen,TS-3688,an EC biosensor based on a glassy carbon gc electrode chemically modified with the perfluorinated cationexchange polymer nafion and MV mv is described the enzyme was immobilized by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde in the presence of bovine serum albumin bsa methyl viologen and nafion operating variables such as the enzymebsa ratio crosslinking time in glutaraldehyde vapor methyl viologen and nafion percentages were investigated with regard to their influence on the biosensor sensitivity by using glucose oxidase as the enzyme MM due to its high stability and low cost the glutamate biosensor was elaborated by using optimized parameters and its electrochemical properties were investigated by CV amperometry and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy the glu biosensor shows a detection limit of microm and a linear range D2 to mm its selectivity was tested with different amino acids each with a concentration of microm microm acetaminophen microm UA and microm ascorbic acid no amperometric response was observed for the interfering species this good selectivity allows glu PCD in biological media without previous separation of the analyte
PC,positive control,TS-3689,there are many reports of defined culture systems for the propagation of human embryonic stem cells in the absence of feeder cell support but no previous T0 has undertaken a multilaboratory comparison of these diverse methodologies in this study five separate laboratories each with experience in human embryonic stem cell SC used a panel of ten embryonic SC lines including wa as an index cell line common to all laboratories to assess eight cell culture methods with propagation in the presence of KO serum replacer fgf and mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cell layers serving as a PC the cultures were assessed for up to ten passages for attachment death and differentiated morphology by phase contrast microscopy for growth by serial cell counts and for maintenance of SC surface marker expression by FC of the eight SC systems only the control and those based on two commercial media mtesr and stempro supported maintenance of most cell lines for ten passages cultures grown in the remaining media failed before this point due to lack of attachment cell death or overt cell differentiation possible explanations for relative success of the commercial formulations in this study and the lack of success with other formulations from academic groups compared to previously published results include the complex combination of growth AF present in the commercial preparations improved development manufacture and SQ control in the commercial products differences in epigenetic adaptation to culture in vitro between different es cell lines grown in different laboratories
ALS,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,TS-3690,ALS als is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to death within a few years after diagnosis malnutrition and WL are frequent and are indexes of poor prognosis TBF and fat distribution have not been studied in als patients

GA,gum arabic,TS-3692,this study aimed at assessing the effect of GA acacia senegal oral treatment on the metabolic profile of chronic renal failure crf patients a total of crf patients under regular haemodialysis and normal subjects participated in this T0 the patients were randomly allocated into three groupsgroup a crf patients under lowprotein diet lpd g day and gum arabic g day TG b crf patients under lpd and GA iron ferrous sulphate mg day and folic acid mg day TG c control group crf patients under lpd and iron and folic acid treatment and group d normal volunteers on ND under daily dose of g gum arabic each of the above treatments was continued for three consecutive months blood samples were collected from each subject before treatment and twice per month predialysis for months PSA parameters measured were SS urea serum creatinine serum UA SS calcium and SS phosphorus by the end of the months of treatment serum urea C2 significantly decreased by and for group a and b respectively compared with the baseline p and control group p SS creatinine C2 significantly decreased in the groups of gum users a b and d by and respectively compared with the control group p there was a significant decrease p in SUA C2 by and for group a and b respectively compared with the baseline SS calcium levels increased by and for group a b and d respectively and these increases were significantly different p from baseline and control group for CG a and b serum phosphorus C2 significantly decreased by for group a for group b and for group d compared with the baseline p from this T0 we conclude that oral administration of GA could conceivably alleviate adverse effects of crf
DA,dopaminergic,TS-3693,tardive dyskinesia has been regarded as a LT complication of neuroleptic administration to patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia however nine of the first fourteen patients evaluated for an investigation of tardive dyskinesia met diagnostic criteria for depression neuroleptics produce blockade of postsynaptic DA receptors TD occurs when neuroleptics are discontinued and is regarded as a manifestation of supersensitive postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors tardive dyskinesia occurs when neuroleptics are discontinued and is regarded as a manifestation of supersensitive postsynaptic DA receptors chronically decreased neurotransmission in the synapse of a patient with depression may contribute to the OD of a supersensitive receptor and could explain the high proportion of patients with depression seen in this sample of patients with tardive dyskinesia
DCP,dicalcium phosphate,TS-3694,the purpose of this T0 was to investigate the influence of excipient type and level on the release of alprazolam formulated in controlled release matrix tablets containing HPMC hpmc each tablet formulation contained alprazolam hpmc methocel kmp excipients and magnesium stearate the soluble excipients investigated were lactose monohydrate sucrose and dextrose and the insoluble excipients included DCP dihydrate DCP anhydrous and calcium sulfate dihydrate the similarity factor f factor was used to compare the dissolution profile of each formulation the insoluble excipients especially DCP dihydrate caused the drug to be released at a slower rate and to a lesser extent than the soluble excipients soluble excipients created a more permeable hydrated gel SL for drug PR increased the porosity resulting in faster diffusion of drug and increased the rate of tablet erosion use of binary mixtures of lactose monohydrate and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate produced PR profiles of intermediate duration rapid drug dissolution was obtained when only ww of lactose monohydrate was present in the tablet formulation only when the DCP dihydrate level was sufficiently high ww was the release rate and extent decreased it was demonstrated that the type and level of excipient influenced the rate and extent of drug release from controlled PR tablets containing hpmc the release mechanism of alprazolam from each tablet formulation was described by either the hixsoncrowell cube root kinetics equation or peppass equation however the different excipient types investigated did not influence the PR mechanism of alprazolam from the final tablets
BA,bioavailability,TS-3695,there are limited reports on the BA and pharmacokinetics of isoflavones in elderly humans and aged animals the present study was conducted to assess the effect of glycosidation of isoflavones on their BA and pharmacokinetics in aged month old male fischer f rats the f rat developed by the national institute on aging is an inbred rat MM that is commonly used for aging studies and resembles many features of aging humans three sources of isoflavones novasoy a commercial supplement a mixture of synthetic aglycons daidzein genistein and glycitein and a mixture of synthetic glucosides daidzin genistin and glycitin were tested following administration blood samples were collected at different times h postoral gavage and h postiv dosing plasma isoflavones and hydroxyhydroxyphenylchroman a metabolite of daidzein were measured by lcms the extent of absorption was determined by comparing the area under the curve auc of the plasmaconcentration time curve after intravenous iv administration with that following oral administration the extent of BA was then calculated as bioabailability aucoraucivxdoseivdoseorx bioavailabilities for genistein were significantly p higher for the aglycon compared with the glucoside forms in contrast the bioavailabilities for glycitein were significantly p higher in novasoy and the glucoside form compared with the aglycon no significant differences in the bioavailability of daidzein were observed in aged rats dosed with aglycon glucoside or novasoy however aged rats were able to produce equol as early as h postdosing in summary the source of isoflavones had significant effects on genistein and glycitein BA in aged male rats
IA,immunoadsorption,TS-3696,cells of clone jtc derived from monkey kidney epithelial cells were found to produce latent collagenase in serumcontaining cultures collagenase production by jtc cells was stimulated more than tenfold with the addition of tetradecanoylphorbolacetate the jtc cell MMP-8 was purified fold over the CS medium to a TPS activity of unitsmg with a yield of by heparinsepharose ionexchange and IA chromatography thus the jtc CC appears to be a useful model for studying the initial degradation of surrounding connective tissues by epithelial tissue in carcinogenesis
AS,androgen suppression,TS-3697,AS in prostate CA is responsible for many SE many studies mostly retrospective have found an association between androgen deprivation and increased cardiovascular morbidity if the cardiovascular impact was chosen an etiological explanation would be the occurrence of metabolic disorders particularly insulin resistance the objective of our work was to conduct a review of the literature assessing the impact of AD on the ON of insuli potential as an ingredient in traditional medicines for the treatment of metabolic disorders and particularly as an antiinflammatory antimicrobial and analgesic agent this review emphasizes on the recent literature and research findings that highlight the significant biological activities of c nucifera linn such as its antiinflammatory antimicrobial and analgesic properties this review can help researchers keen on exploiting the therapeutic potential of c nucifera linn which may motivate them to further explore their commercial viability
AM,autobiographical memory,TS-3698,the purpose of this T0 is to develop a valid and reliable measure for the phenomenology of autobiographical memories the psychometric properties of the AM characteristics questionnaire amcq were tested in three studies the factor structure of the amcq was examined for childhood memories in study n for autobiographical memories related to romantic relationships in study n and for selfdefining memories in T0 n the explanatory factor analyses performed for each memory type demonstrated the consistency of the amcq factor structure across all SM types while a confirmatory factor analysis on the data garnered from all three studies supported the constructs for the autobiographical memory characteristics defined by the researchers the amcq consists of items and factors and the internal consistency values of all scales were ranged between and the relationships between the amcq scales related to gender and individual emotions as well as the intercorrelations among the scales were consistent with both theoretical expectations and previous findings the results of all the three studies indicated that this new SF-36 is a reliable and robust measure for SM phenomenology
SD,standard diet,TS-3699,five CG of mice received for months one of the following diets t SD t a t CA acid b t cholic acid betasitosterol c t chenodeoxycholic acid d t chenodeoxycholic acid betasitosterol T3 this time the cholesterol intestinal absorption and the biliary secretion of lipids were measured the biliary secretion of cholesterol the total hepatic cholesterol mgg CL dry weight and the intestinal absorption of cholesterol administered dose were higher in mice fed with cholic acid than in mice fed with chenodeoxycholic acid hepatic cholesterol mgg CL dry weight absorption po dose the addition of betasitosterol to the diet supplemented with CA acid decreased the cholesterol intestinal absorption and the biliary secretion of cholesterol so that both became similar to that obtained with chenodeoxycholic acid these results indicate that in mice as in man CA acid elicits a higher cholesterol biliary secretion than chenodeoxycholic acid in this exp model the distinct effect on the biliary cholesterol of these two bile salts is due to their TPS effects on the intestinal absorption of cholesterol
PRR,pattern recognition receptors,TS-3700,the extreme vulnerability of preterm infants to invasive microbial infections has been attributed to immature innate immune defenses monocytes are important innate immune sentinel cells critical in the defense against infection in blood they achieve this via diverse mechanisms that include pathogen recognition receptor and inflammasomemediated detection of microbes migration into INF tissues and differentiation into mÏ\x95s and dendritic cells initiation of the inflammatory cascade by free radicals and cytokinechemokine production pathogen clearance by phagocytosis and intracellular killing and the removal of apoptotic cells relatively little is known about these cells in PT infants especially about how their phenotype adapts to changes in the microbial environment during the immediate PN period overall preterm monocytes exhibit attenuated proinflammatory cytokine responses following stimulation by whole bacterial or specific microbial components in vitro these attenuated cytokine responses cannot be explained by a lack of intracellular signaling events downstream of PRR this hyporesponsiveness also contrasts with mature termlike phagocytosis capabilities detectable even in the most premature infant finally human data on the effects of fetal chorioamnionitis on monocyte biology are incomplete and inconsistent in this review we present an integrated view of human studies focused on mo functions in PT infants we discuss how a developmental immaturity of these cells may contribute to preterm infants susceptibility to infections
CA,contact angle,TS-3701,ceramic ultrafiltration CM has drawn increasing attention in drinking water treatment sectors as an alternative to traditional polymeric counterparts yet only limited information has been made available about the characteristics of ceramic membrane fouling by NK organic matter the effects of solution chemistry including ionic strength divalent ion concentration and ph on the flux behavior were comparatively evaluated for ceramic and polymeric UF of synthetic water containing MM NK organic matter filtration characteristics were further probed via resistanceinseries MM analysis fouling visualization using quantum dots batch adsorption test CA measurement solutemembrane surface adhesion force measurement and quantitative comparison of fouling characteristics between ceramic and polymeric CM the results collectively suggested that the effects of solution chemistry on fouling SMB of ceramic membranes were generally similar to polymeric counterparts in terms of trends while the extent varied significantly depending on water quality parameters lower fouling tendency and enhanced cleaning efficiency were observed with the ceramic membrane further promoting the potential for ceramic membrane application to surface water treatment
PP,posterior pituitary,TS-3702,this study examined changes in the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase th in the stalkmedian eminence sme and PP pp during the preovulatory prl surge immature female rats were injected with pmsg on day blood prl C2 were low on the morning of day rose to a peak from h remained at a lower plateau from h and declined to basal levels on the morning of day sme pp and striatum were removed from pmsgtreated rats at selected times during the periovulatory period and from agematched control rats th activity was determined in tissue homogenates by a coupled hydroxylationdecarboxylation CA apparent km and maximum velocity values with respect to methyl tetrahydropterine were estimated from substrate saturation curves the kinetic parameters for th in either the sme or the pp of control rats were similar at and h on day however the apparent km in both tissues was significantly lower than that in the striatum the affinity of th in the sme and pp was unchanged before and during the peak phase of the prl surge reduced significantly during the late plateau and returned to presurge C2 in the morning of day th activity in the striatum was similar at all times examined to determine the state of activation of the enzyme tissue homogenates were preincubated with camp atp and magnesium th activity in the sme during the peak phase was unchanged by camp and that in the pp was modestly increased the relatively inactive enzyme in both tissues during the plateau phase was markedly activated by a campdependent mechanism the LA of striatal th was greatly increased by camp at both times these data suggest that th in the sme and pp exists in an activated state most of the time and is transiently inactivated during the plateau phase of the prl surge in contrast th in the striatum is relatively inactive in the basal state and is not affected by hormonal changes induced by pmsg we conclude that the peak prl surge occurs in spite of active dopamine da neurons suggesting that it is generated by a nondopaminergic mechanism decreased th activity in da neurons in the sme and pp may prolong the prl surge during the plateau phase whereas increased da activity coincides with the termination of the surge
NP,nasopharynx,TS-3703,in vivo demonstration of hypoxia is of significance for tumour patient management fluorine fluoromisonidazole ffmiso is a proven hypoxic imaging agent we developed an ffmiso tumour to muscle retention ratio tmrr for the detection of tumour hypoxia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma npc data were acquired by positron emission tomography pet of the NP and neck T3 intravenous i.t. of mbq of ffmiso two imaging protocols were adopted a long protocol for comprehensive dynamic information and a short protocol for a simple clinically convenient imaging procedure tomograms were reconstructed and evaluated visually roi analysis on the basis of timeactivity curve DUE was performed to calculate the tmrr of npc or cervical nodal metastases cnms in relation to the suboccipital muscles at h the calculation of the tmrr was exactly the same for both the long and the short protocol as two min composite frames had been created immediately T3 i.v. and h after injection of ffmiso in the long protocol the T/N to muscle retention ratio ntmrr was derived similarly from the normal NP the data of controls and patients with npc were analysed the long protocol was used in patients and the short protocol in nine in controls the mean ntmrr sd was the mean tmrrs for npc and cnms were and respectively these values were significantly higher than the mean ntmrr for normal controls p in each case at the PR threshold value of tumour hypoxia occurred in of the primary lesions of npc and of cnms the tmrr for UC was significantly lower than that for nonkeratinized carcinoma p the ffmiso tmrr is a simple and clinically useful index for detecting tumour hypoxia in npc
IM,internal medicine,TS-3704,developing housestaff and faculty in their roles as medical educators is a dynamic process the rigorous clinical DUE method used during the thirdyear IM clerkship at the uniformed services university uniquely incorporates faculty OD into the process of DUE and generating feedback for students formal evaluation sessions are held monthly at all clerkship sites throughout the week clerkship and are moderated by either the internal medicine clerkship director or the onsite clerkship directors although designed to provide an opportunity for faculty to evaluate student performance and prepare formative FB the sessions also CF as formal planned and longitudinal forums of RT casebased faculty OD that address professional instructional and leadership development the evaluation sessions are used as a means to model and teach the key concepts of the stanford faculty development program providing a unifying form of DUE across multiple teaching sites and settings makes formal evaluation sessions a powerful stateoftheart tool for faculty development
NS,negative symptoms,TS-3705,there is a pressing need to find and develop new AP agents for the treatment of schizophrenia current drugs primarily target dopamine d receptors and are only ERP in the treatment of the positive PS of this indication the tetrahydroprotoberberine NK product Â±govadine has shown unique promise for the treatment of both the positive and NS of schizophrenia as it targets both dopamine d and d receptors however further clinical research has been hindered by the lack of availability of significant quantities of enantioenriched material a new enantioselective synthetic route has been developed that affords govadine in overall yield over steps from commercially available dopamine and homovanillic acid derivatives using only minor modifications in the synthetic route govadine can be synthesized in comparable yields and enantioselectivities the route is readily scalable as every intermediate was purified by crystallization and no flash column chromatography was necessary
GA,general anaesthetic,TS-3706,dental treatment of the preschool child in hospital is usually carried out under a GA anaesthetic following referral from a dentist the reasons for a GA are that the child has either proved unable to accept treatment because of dental anxiety or extreme youth or has a severe medical problem which requires dental care to be carried out in a hospital environment the costs of such treatment are necessarily high and account of these is taken in the description of the services offered and their organization the need for prevention is also stressed
LP,low passage,TS-3707,an isolate of sarcocystis neurona sn was obtained from the spinal cord of a horse with neurologic signs the parasite was isolated in cultures of bovine monocytes and equine SP cells the organism divided by endopolygeny and completed at least one asexual cycle in cell cultures in days the parasite was maintained by subpassages in bovine monocytes for months when it was found to be nonpathogenic to gamma interferon knockout ko mice revival of a LP th passage of the initial isolate stored in liquid nitrogen for months retained its pathogenicity for ko mice merozoites of the late passage nd passage were infective to only one of four ko mice inoculated similar results were obtained with sn isolate of s neurona no differences were found in western blot patterns using antigens from the low and high passage merozoites of the sn and sn isolates these results suggest that prolonged passage in CC may affect the pathogenicity of some isolates of s neurona
PN,pronucleus,TS-3708,CGs are secretory vesicles poised at the cortex of an egg that upon stimulation by sperm contact at fertilization secrete their contents these contents modify the extracellular environment and block additional sperm from reaching the egg the role of cortical granules in blocking polyspermy is conserved throughout much of phylogeny in the sea urchin CGs accumulate throughout the cytoplasm during oogenesis but in mature eggs the cortical granules are attached to the plasma membrane having translocated to the cortex at some earlier time to T0 the process of cortical granule translocation to the cell surface we have devised a procedure for maturation of sea urchin oocytes in vitro using this procedure we examined the rate of oocyte maturation by observing the movement and GVBD the formation of polar bodies and the formation of the egg pronucleus we find that oocyte maturation takes approximately hours in the species used here lytechinus variegatus from the earliest indication of maturation germinal vesicle movement to formation of a distinct PN we then observed the translocation of CGs in these cells by immunolocalization using a monoclonal antibody to hyalin a protein packaged specifically in cortical LG we found that the translocation of cortical LG in in vitromatured oocytes begins with the movement of the germinal vesicle to the oocyte cell surface and is complete hour T3 germinal vesicle breakdown in the in vitromatured egg of the cortical LG are at the SC indistinguishable from translocation in oocytes that mature in vivo we have also found that eggs that mature in vitro are functionally identical to eggs that mature in vivo by four criteria the matured cells undergo a selective turnover of mrna encoding cortical granule contents the newly formed PN begins transcription of histone messages cortical LG that translocate in vitro are capable of exocytosis upon activation by the calcium ionophore a the mature egg is fertilizable and undergoes normal cleavage and development in vitro oocyte maturation enables us to examine the mechanism of cortical granule translocation and other processes that had previously only been observed in static sections of fixed ovaries
PE,pulmonary emphysema,TS-3709,familial idiopathic nonarteriosclerotic CBF calcification fincc constitutes a rare but pathologically well defined disorder thus far CNS system PS and signs have been the only recorded expression of this disease AD and autosomal recessive inheritance have both been postulated as cause we describe three sibs who had symmetrical CBF calcifications but three also had cirrhosis and pulmonary emphysema two had congenital cerebral aneurysms all were male and of SS they also had delayed development and seizures and two had other neurologic deficits one sib died at age years of hepatic failure and portal hypertension ruptured cerebral aneurysms led to the death of the other two boys at ages and years the CBF calcifications symmetrically involved the basal ganglia and thalami the dentate nucleus and the cortical and subcortical areas of the cerebrum the CL was studied by sequential biopsies in two of the children and in all three by autopsy fatty degeneration and portal fibrosis preceded a periportal and micronodular cirrhosis severe BL PE was present in one sib at age years whereas all three had bullae and cysts at autopsy ruptured left middle cerebral artery aneurysms were demonstrated in two sibs and one also had aneurysms of the anterior and posterior communicating arteries we conclude that in this family fincc is a complex pleiotropic mendelian mutation either of autosomal or xlinked recessive nature whose basic pathogenesis remains unknown but may involve a metabolic defect this form of fincc may be a previously undescribed syndrome or a form of fincc in which extraneural manifestations were previously overlooked

CRF,cancerrelated fatigue,TS-3711,there is an increasing emphasis on using translational research to examine mechanisms and increase our understanding of disease translational research involves the use of basic science techniques to generate new treatments for use in a clinical setting the so called bench to bedside RPA this methodology could be used to enhance our understanding of complex PS such as cancerrelated fatigue this review will examine specifically the potential role of the science of protein structure and function proteomics as a technique to improve our knowledge in this area this will include an explanation of the TPS methods used in this research in order to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of CRF and discuss potential directions for future research with the development of more targeted therapies
SSA,superoxide scavenging activity,TS-3712,nine patients with mechanical or osteoarthritic knee pain present for more than weeks were evaluated by CE needle arthroscopy and standard arthroscopy each knee was assessed for PF cartilage disruption cartilage abnormalities in the tibiofemoral joints meniscal tears and synovitis needle arthroscopy was performed immediately before standard arthroscopy in the operating room under local anesthesia six of the nine patients had magnetic resonance imaging mri scans before the arthroscopic procedures the CE was CS for the PCD of patellofemoral disease sensitive for medial meniscal tears and sensitive for lateral meniscal tears visualization of the femoraltibial joint was significantly better with standard arthroscopy than with needle arthroscopy p percent visualization with the needle arthroscope was higher for the PF and the medical tibiofemoral cartilage compared to the lateral tibiofemoral cartilage and menisci p the needle arthroscope and mri scan were equivalent to the standard arthroscope in the detection of patellofemoral cartilage disruption of any depth and in the detection of meniscal tears however the standard arthroscope was better in detecting cartilage CA in the medial and lateral joint spaces p and p respectively the costs for diagnostic standard arthroscopy needle arthroscopy and mri of the knee in an academic center are and respectively these data suggest that the majority of reversible causes of knee pain are diagnosed by PCS examination therefore after a complete PH and physical examination if the physician thinks that the patient has an ID of the knee and that surgical MI is needed we suggest that the patient go directly to standard arthroscopy which offers bottermination of cyanidinglucoside the predominant anthocyanin diglucoside and rutinoside paeonidinglucoside diglucoside and rutinoside delphinidinglucoside and rutinoside pelargonidinglucoside diglucoside and rutinoside quercetin its glucoside and rutinoside EC protocatechuic gentisic ellagic ferulic caffeic chlorogenic and coumaric acids the phenolic fraction displayed folinciocalteu reagent reducing microg of GA equivalentmg and dpph and SSA ic and microgml and inhibited rat liver microsome peroxidation ic microgml the freezedried fruit and its phenolic fraction reduced the biofilm formation and adhesion to the artificial surface of candida parapsilosis staphylococcus epidermidis escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and Sm
NB,negative binomial,TS-3713,fatigued and drowsy driving has been found to be a L1 cause of truck crashes lack of sleep is the number one cause of fatigue and drowsiness however there are limited data on the sleep patterns sleep duration sleep percentage in the duration of nonwork period and the time when sleep occurred of truck drivers in nonwork periods and the impact on driving performance this paper examined sleep patterns of commercial truck drivers during nonwork periods and evaluated the influence these sleep patterns had on truck driving performance data were from the naturalistic truck driving T0 each driver participated in the T0 for approximately four weeks a shift was defined as a nonwork period followed by a work period a total of shifts were identified four distinct sleep patterns were identified based on sleep duration sleep startend point in a nonwork period and the percentage of sleep with reference to the duration of nonwork period driving performance was measured by safetycritical events which included crashes nearcrashes crashrelevant conflicts and unintentional lane deviations NB regression was used to evaluate the association between the sleep patterns and driving performance adjusted for driver demographic information the results showed that the sleep pattern with the highest safetycritical event rate was associated with shorter sleep sleep in the early stage of a nonwork period and less sleep between am and am this T0 also found that male drivers with fewer years of commercial vehicle driving experience and higher body mass index were associated with deteriorated driving performance and increased driving risk the results of this T0 could inform hoursofservice policymaking and benefit safety management in the trucking industry
CN,contrast nephropathy,TS-3714,increasing numbers of patients undergo preemptive renal transplantation obtaining cardiac catheterizations prior to transplantation to screen for coronary artery disease is controversial because of the perceived risk of inducing CN and the need for dialysis in patients with marginal renal CF we sought to examine the true impact of cardiac catheterization on time to dialysis in a cohort of preemptive renal transplant candidates
FS,field stimulation,TS-3715,we have examined the effects of repeated SE to antigen on airway responses to cholinergic stimulation in two inbred strains of mice that are similar in underlying ACh AR yet differ in their ability to produce ige both balbc and sjlj mice were repeatedly exposed to ovalbumin by inhalation for a d period while the balbc mice developed ige antibody to this allergen the sjlj CS failed to mount an appreciable ige response in vitro assessments of the response of TSM from saline exposed mice controls of both strains demonstrated responses to both methacholine and EFS that were not significantly different between the strains following exposure to ovalbumin the balbc strain developed a significant increase in their response to electrical FS while their response to methacholine was unaltered in contrast the in vitro responsiveness to these stimuli did not increase in sjlj mice following similar SE to inhaled nebulized ovalbumin the passive transfer of cells from the peribronchial CL NO of ovalbuminsensitized balbc mice into syngeneic nonimmune mice also led to increases in responsiveness of tracheal smooth muscle to electrical FS in contrast transfer of cells from nonsensitized mice did not alter responsiveness these results suggest that mu species capable of developing an ige response to allergen also develop alterations in the neural control of their airways further this alteration appears to be lymphocyte dependent in that cells found within peribronchial lymph NO following allergen exposure are capable of transferring this increase in responsiveness to nonimmune mice
BL,body length,TS-3716,relative weights of HR spleen pancreas and CL and the relative lengths of the small intestine and the cecum were taken from farmbred and wild juvenile redlegged partridges alectoris rufa linnaeus in CE spain expressed as a ratio to head and BL farmbred partridges had lighter NF lighter spleens and livers and shorter small intestines and cecae than wild birds of the same age when expressed as a ratio to body weight farmbred juvenile redlegged partridges had lighter hearts and livers and shorter small intestines and cecae than wild partridges those differences might have been produced by diet differences such as fiberpoor highenergy feeds used on farms and may affect the survival of farmbred partridges T3 PR
BM,bronchial mucosa,TS-3717,thirteen colloid cysts cc four rathke cleft cysts rcc three follicular cysts of normal pituitary gland fcp four enterogenous cysts ec three normal choroid plexi cp three choroid plexus papillomas cpp and several samples of normal BM and ependyma were studied by electron microscopy the ultrastructure of most of the cc was indistinguishable from that of rcc fcp ec and normal BM in demonstrating nonciliated and ciliated epithelial cells goblet cells basal cells and intermediate forms some showing evidence of early squamous differentiation two cc displayed mostly squamous differentiation and one contained basally situated cells resembling ME cells although the rcc and fcp displayed features similar to those of cc they also contained cells with electrondense granules indicating PIT hormone production and scattered cells showing oncocytic change ec were lined by either squamous cells or mucinproducing columnar cells every cc rcc fcp and ec contained cells covered by glycocalyx in contrast to aforementioned lesions ependymal lining cp and cpp were composed of a single cell type one with numerous villi few cilia and no signs of keratinization mucin production or glycocalyx coating it is concluded that the ultrastructural properties of cc are the same as those of cysts of endodermal or ectodermal origin and of respiratory mucosa no ultrastructural similarities were observed between cc and normal or neoplastic NE these ultrastructural findings support the concept of an enterogenous origin of colloid cysts and highlight their similarity to rcc
PE,pigmented epithelium,TS-3718,postsurgical macular oedema results from bloodretinal barrier breakdown but it is not accompanied by structural CA in the retinal vessels or retinal PE previous studies using horseradish peroxidase in a primate model suggested that leakage occurs primarily through this epithelium this study was conducted to localize CS of the barrier breakdown in humans following different types of intraocular surgery and to compare them with eyes affected with ocular inflammatory disease ocular infection and choroidal melanoma paraffin sections of eyes were IHC stained for albumin to localize extravascular albumin which was graded in a masked study with aphakiapseudophakia penetrating keratoplasty ocular inflammatory disease ocular infection and choroidal melanoma barrier breakdown occurred primarily at the inner bloodretinal barrier retinal vasculature but leakage also occurred at the outer barrier retinal PE after retinal reattachment surgery the inner and outer bloodretinal barriers were equally compromised V1 leakage in the ONH coincided with barrier failure in these disorders the widespread pattern of bloodretinal barrier compromise with leakage at multiple sites suggests that soluble mediators are likely to play a role in postsurgical macular oedema ocular inflammatory disease and choroidal melanoma
IO,insideout,TS-3719,atpsensitive k katp channels are essential for maintaining the cellular homeostasis against metabolic AS myocardial CR in various pathologies may alter this adaptive response to such AS it was reported that transmural electrophysiological heterogeneity exists in ventricular myocardium therefore we hypothesized that the katp channel properties might be altered in hypertrophied myocytes from endocardium to test this hypothesis we determined the katp channel currents using the perforated patchclamp technique open cellattached patches and excised IO patches in both Endo and epicardial myocytes isolated from hypertrophied spontaneous hypertensive rats shr vs normal wistarkyoto rats wky left ventricle in Endo cells katp channel currents ikatp produced by mm cn and no gl at mv were significantly smaller p and time required to reach peak currents after onset of katp channel opening timeonset to peak was significantly longer vs s p in the shr group n than the wky group n however in epicardial cells there were no differences in ikatp and timeonset to peak between the groups shr n wky n the concentrationopen probabilityresponse curves obtained during the SE of open cells and excised patches to exogenous atp revealed the impaired katp channel activation in Endo myocytes from shr in conclusion katp channel activation under metabolic AS was impaired in Endo cells from rat hypertrophied LV the deficit of Endo katp channels to decreased intracellular atp might contribute to the maladaptive response of hypertrophied NF to ischemia
GM,germinal matrix,TS-3720,the newborn beagle pup serves as a model for neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage ivh fluctuations in GM blood flow are left to play a L1 role in the pathogenesis of ivh we studied regional cerebral blood flow in awake newborn beagle pups utilizing ciodoantipyrine as a blood flow indicator and quantitative ARG the equilibrium tissueblood partition coefficient for iodoantipyrine was for grey matter blood flow was calculated for CBF cortex FC ml gmin subcortical nuclear structures eg Cd ml gmin VWM structure centrum semiovale ml gmin and GM ml gmin mean se we conclude that under normal physiologic conditions the GM receives relatively low blood flow this information can be used for comparison with germinal matrix blood flow during adverse exp conditions
GT,glucose transport,TS-3721,insulin resistance is a characteristic feature of type ii diabetes mellitus and obesity although defects in glucose homeostasis have been recognized for decades the molecular mechanisms accounting for impaired whole body gl uptake are still not fully understood skeletal muscle constitutes the largest insulinsensitive organ in humans thus insulin resistance in this tissue will have a L1 impact on whole body glucose homeostasis intense efforts are under way to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate glucose metabolism and gene expression in insulinsensitive tissues knowledge of the human genome CS used in concert with gene andor protein array technology will provide a powerful means to facilitate efforts in revealing molecular targets that regulate glucose homeostasis in type ii diabetes mellitus this will offer quicker ways forward to identifying gene expression profiles in insulinsensitive and insulinresistant human tissue this review will present our current understanding of potential defects in insulin signal transduction pathways with an emphasis on mechanisms regulating GT in skeletal muscle from people with type ii diabetes mellitus elucidation of the pathways involved in the regulation of gl homeostasis will offer insight into the causation of insulin resistance and type ii diabetes mellitus furthermore this will identify PSA entry points for drug MI to improve gl homeostasis
MAP,mitogenactivated protein,TS-3722,p MAP kinases mapks are G1 primarily in response to inflammatory cytokines and cellular stress and inhibitors which target the palpha and pbeta mapks have shown potential for the treatment of inflammatory disease here we report the generation and initial characterization of a knockout of the pbeta mapk gene pbeta mice were viable and exhibited no apparent health problems the expression and activation of palpha erk and jnk in response to cellular stress was normal in embryonic fibroblasts from pbeta mice as was the activation e to introduction of ercp
CM,carboxymethyl,TS-3723,ribose phosphate rp undergoes the maillard reaction with amines at significantly higher rates than most other sugars and sugar phosphates the presence of an intramolecular phosphate group which catalyzes the early stages of the MR provides the opportunity for the rp molecule to undergo novel reaction paths creating unique maillard products the initial set of reactions leading to an amadori product phosphorylated and to an alphadicarbonyl phosphate compound follows a typical maillard reaction CS but an observed phosphate hydrolysis accompanying the reaction adds to the complexity of the products formed the reaction rate for the loss of rp is partially dependent on the pka of the amine but also is correlated to the protonation of an early intermediate of the reaction sequence in the presence of oxygen a CM group conjugated to the amine is a L1 product of the reaction of rp with nacetyllysine while little of this product is generated in the absence of oxygen despite lacking a critical hydroxyl group necessary for the MR deoxyribose phosphate drp still generates an amadorilike product with a carbonyl on the c carbon and undergoes phosphate cleavage two highly uvabsorbing products of drp were amine derivatives of methylenepyrrolone and formylpyrrole the reaction of drp with certain amines generates a set of products that exhibit an interesting absorbance at nm and a high fluorescence
DOE,design of experiments,TS-3724,anticipated shortages in donated blood supply have prompted investigation of alternative approaches for in IVP of red blood cells rbcs such as expansion of conditional immortalization erythroid progenitors however there is a bioprocessing challenge wherein AF promoting maximal cell expansion and growthlimiting inhibitory AF are yet to be investigated the authors use an erythroblast cell L1 imery derived from immortalizing cdcda erythroblast from adult IP blood for optimization of expansion SC conditions DOE doe is used in media formulation to explore relationships and interactive effects between AF which affect cell expansion our inhouse optimized medium formulation produced significantly higher cell densities Â± Ã\x97
TC,tubocurarine,TS-3725,ascending tract neurones located in the dorsal horn of sacral segments of the spinal cord have been investigated by extracellular and intracellular recording in the anaesthetized cat the aim was to determine whether information from group ii afferents that terminate within the sacral segments is conveyed to supraspinal structures and which types of neurones are involved a considerable proportion of ascending tract neurones found in the dorsal horn in the same segments as the pudendal onufs motor nucleus were excited by group ii muscle afferents the great majority of these neurones had axons ascending in ipsilateral funiculi spinocervical tract neurones constituted the largest proportion of such neurones while very few SCT and propriospinal neurones and no postsynaptic dorsal column neurones were found among them in addition to activation by group ii muscle afferents all of the neurones were strongly excited by cutaneous afferents the most potent excitation was evoked by afferents of the posterior bicepssemitendinosus and GM nerves and by afferents of the cutaneous femoris sural and pudendal nerves the latencies of intracellularly recorded excitatory potentials were indicative of a high incidence of monosynaptic coupling between the afferents and ascending tract neurones the highly ERP MSR excitation of spinocervical tract neurones in the sacral segments by group ii afferents is in contrast to the weak disynaptically mediated actions of group ii afferents on such neurones in the ll segments but comparable to the actions of group ii afferents on ascending tract neurones in the midlumbar segments both the patterns of IP input and the latencies of synaptic actions in ascending tract neurones were similar to those in interneurones at the same locations accompanying report similar information is therefore like changes in epc quantal content associated with both nicotinic antagonists were due to changes in the size of the pool of quanta in the nerve terminal available for immediate release with no effect on the probability of PR of an individual quantum the results are interpreted in terms of two separately identifiable prejunctional actions of the nicotinic antagonists both involving an action at nicotinic ach receptors situated on the motor nerve terminal thus at high frequencies of motor nerve stimulation tubocurarine and vecuronium produce a caoindependent decrease in ach release probably through an GABA action on a positivefeedback prejunctional nicotinic autoreceptor closely related to the muscletype nicotinic ach autoreceptor however at low frequencies of motor nerve stimulation we suggest that TC but not VEC produces a caodependent increase in ach release through an action at a negativefeedback prejunctional neuronaltype nicotinic ach autoreceptor
US,sonography,TS-3726,the objective of this T0 was to determine the optimal gestational age for examining fetal anatomy and nuchal translucency in the first trimester in a prospective crosssectional study women from an unselected population underwent a detailed assessment of fetal anatomy at weeks of gestation confirmed by C-R with the use of TA US and transvaginal sonography when necessary visualization of fetal anatomy improved with increasing gestational age and of cases could be visualized at and weeks of gestation respectively and was similarly high at weeks the ability to measure nuchal translucency was similar from weeks to and success rate but fell to at weeks the need for TV US steadily decreased with increasing gestational age being and at and weeks respectively from these data it appears that the optimal gestational age to examine fetal anatomy and measure nuchal translucency in the first trimester is weeks
CA,cochlear aqueduct,TS-3727,the patency of the CA is a key factor in intracochlear hydromechanics if patent the CSF fluid csf provides the reference pressure for the perilymph and also to a C1 extent the endolymph since RM can only withstand a relatively small pressure differential the aqueduct often becomes sealed as a NK process of ageing in this instance the REF pressure is from a source its position unknown within the boundaries of the cochlea itself relatively C1 and rapid changes in the CSF fluid pressure may result from everyday events such as coughing ca mm saline and sneezing ca mm saline the resistive nature of the CA and the mechanical compliance of the cochlear windows are probably important factors in limiting the amount of stress and therefore possible damage which may occur to the cochlea and cochlear windows for a given pressure change within the csf system a narrow aqueduct and compliant cochlear windows reduce the risk of structural damage in practice this should mean that the risk of structural damage will be increased by any process which reduces the compliance of one or both of the cochlear windows for example extremes of middle ear pressure perhaps brought about by ET dysfunction or rapid PB changes techniques are now available which provide noninvasive indirect measures of perilymphatic pressure and csfperilymphatic pressure transfer the tympanic membrane displacement measurement technique has been used to provide reliable measures of perilymphatic pressure and csfperilymphatic pressure transfer on an individual subject basisabstract truncated at words
BT,bleeding time,TS-3728,one hundred and sixtyeight children aged months to years with acquired platelet dysfunction with eosinophilia apde were studied the male to female ratio was all of the children were in good health and no history of any drug ingestion was detected all of the children had widespread spontaneous bruising on the extremities body and face off and on severe bleeding PS were detected in of these patients the number of platelets in these children was within the normal range but the platelet morphology was abnormal in all of them eosinophilia was detected in of these children prolonged BT was detected in of these patients abnormal PLT adhesiveness was found in of cases abnormal PLT aggregation induced by collagen was the most sensitive test in these patients abnormal adp PR from the platelets was detected in these patients by the absence of a second wave of aggregation during stimulation of prp by adp or epinephrine abnormal or no atp secretion from the platelets during stimulation by adp EN or collagen was detected in these patients ristocetininduced PLT aggregation was normal in these children decreased or absence of PLT dense LG by tem T0 was detected in some patients these changes in platelet functions and morphology may be due to acquired storage pool deficiency of the PLT parasitic infection was detected in of these children about of these children with apde had serum total ige higher than iuml there was no correlation between the number of eosinophils and SS total ige and the severity of one PS the majority of children with apde did not receive any treatment except those who had severe bleeding PS which required platelet concentrate to stop one in more than of the patients the bruising or ecchymosis disappeared within months and the abnormal platelet functions returned to normal within months recurrence of these one syndromes was detected in of the children
RE,right ear,TS-3729,glucoamylase overproducing a niger t was mutated by uv mutagensis an extracellular acid proteasedeficient mutant a niger t which produced only extracellular ans of both the right and left ears were longer in males than females in righthanders the hearing duration of the RE was longer than that of the LE in lefthanders the hearing duration of the left ear was longer than that of the RA ear these results suggest a male superiority in auditory perceptual acuity a leftear advantage in lefthanders may result in the superiority of nonrighthanders in musical tasks
ILP,isolated limb perfusion,TS-3730,histamine hi combined to MEL in a rat experimental MM of ILP ilp for lower limb soft tissue sarcoma resulted in overall response rates or of likewise ilp with interleukin il resulted in or of when combined to melphalan in the same experimental MM in systemic immunotherapy the combination of il and hi has been used for solid tumor treatment based on immunomodulatory effects in this T0 we used our wellestablished ilp experimental MM to evaluate whether the synergistic effect between the two drugs seen in the SVR setting could further improve response rates in a locoregional setting histological evaluation was done directly and h T3 ilp melphalan uptake by RT and muscle were measured hi and il together combined to melphalan in the ilp led to or of only histology of PT demonstrated partial loss of hiinduced hemorrhagic effect when il was present MEL accumulation in the tumor when both hi and il were added fold was very similar to accumulation with hi only fold or il only fold combined to melphalan in vitro there was no synergy between the drugs in conclusion there was a negative synergistic effect between il and hi in the regional setting
RDS,replicative dna synthesis,TS-3731,this T0 was designed to test whether concentration or dose of nacl was responsible for the initial tissue damage after min and resulting temporary cell proliferation at h in stomach mucosa of male f rats after gastric intubation of and m nacl histological damage was studied by dual IF combining horseradish peroxidaselabeled griffonia simplicifolia agglutininii staining hrpgsaii and periodic acid cold thioninschiff reaction pats cell proliferation was studied by measuring RDS with LS counting and by brdu IF nacl at the same overall dose of gkg body weight induced different degrees of response depending on the concentration for ml of m nacl there was no tissue damage after min nor any increase in replicative dna synthesis T3 h in the pyloric mucosa administration of m nacl ml m nacl ml and m nacl ml induced concentrationdependent damage of the surface mucous cell layer T3 min and increased RDS T3 h p concentrationdependent increase in RDS at h was also induced with the same volume ml of and m nacl while a volumedependent increase in RDS at h was induced with and ml of m nacl however a greater increase in RDS was always observed when using higher nacl concentrations at the same dose LS counting was wellcorrelated with brdu IF these results suggest that a high concentration of nacl is responsible for the initial tissue damage and resulting temporary cell proliferation during stomach RT promotion
CT,crista terminalis,TS-3732,in the development of atrial flutter due to reentry the CT is supposed to pose a conduction barrier but the role of its longitudinal conduction in determining the propagation DP of the reentrant impulse is not known in rb right atrialrgeon dr w harry archer was one that affected and inspired and sometimes incensed those who knew him and those who would follow him his life long devotion to the dental specialty of oral surgery was a driving force that caused dramatic changes in aspects of not only oral surgery but of dentistry as a whole his excellence in leadership teaching research and writing were among his many accomplishments that firmly place him among the eternal giants of the dental community
SA,status asthmaticus,TS-3733,status asthmaticus is an old term which has been defined in many different ways two distinctive features are usually used to identify status asthmaticus severity and lack of response to bronchodilators however the latter condition is not always observed and thus the term status asthmaticus basically implies severity severe acute asthma is a new term which has replaced SA nevertheless a severe attack of asthma may occur suddenly or can take place after days or weeks of a progressive deterioration a status asthmaticus can be acute or subacute according to the rate of deterioration therefore the term severe acute asthma is misleading since the term SA essentially implies severity severe attacks would be better described as severe exacerbation of asthma sea classification of the sea into two types acute and subacute could help to reveal the etiology of the attack and might also be relevant to the management of the patient for instance an acute sea can be seen in brittle asthma and in patients with aspirin intolerance on the other hand patients with the subacute form are refractory to bronchodilators and must be treated with corticosteroids
BP,binding potential,TS-3734,mesoaccumbal and NS projections are sensitive to stress and heightened stress sensitivity is thought to confer risk for NP disorders serotonin c htc receptors mediate the inhibitory effects of serotonin on dopaminergic circuitry in experimental animals and preclinical findings have implicated htc receptors in motivated behaviors and psychotropic drug mechanisms in humans a common missense singlenucleotide change rs cysser in the htc receptor gene htrc has been associated with altered activity in vitro and with clinical mood disorders we hypothesized that DA circuitry would be more CS to AS in humans carrying the ser variant to test this hypothesis we studied healthy humans using positron emission tomography and the displaceable dd receptor radiotracer craclopride BP bpnd was quantified before and after a standardized AS challenge consisting of min of moderate deep muscular pain and reduction in bpnd served as an index of dopamine release the cysser variant was genotyped on a custom array and ancestry informative markers were used to control for population stratification we found greater dopamine PR in the nucleus accumbens caudate nucleus and putamen among ser carriers after controlling for sex age and ancestry TT accounted for of the variance in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens there was no association of cysser with baseline bpnd these findings indicate that a putatively functional htrc variant ser is associated with greater striatal dopamine release during pain in healthy humans mesoaccumbal stress sensitivity may mediate the effects of htrc R2 on risk of neuropsychiatric disorders
BA,brachial artery,TS-3735,to determine the effects of statins on vascular CF inflammation and androgen levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos we randomized women with pcos who had MDA-LDL cholesterol levels mgdl to atorvastatin mgday or placebo for weeks and found that ATV reduced androgen levels biomarkers of inflammation and blood pressure increased insulin levels and BA conductance during reactive hyperemia and failed to improve BA flowmediated dilation we conclude that until additional studies demonstrate a clear risktobenefit ratio favoring statin therapy in pcos statins should only be used in women with pcos who meet current indications for statin treatment
EMA,ecological momentary assessment,TS-3736,a growing body of research in clinical psychology is now relying on EMA ema ema is fitted to investigate fluctuating processes and as such it is of particular interest in a clinical context in which patients are often characterized by fluctuating behaviors and affective states or symptoms ema typically involves frequent selfevaluations over long periods which may influence patient response the present T0 aimed to determine whether ema followups could influence the participants selfevaluations over time the sample comprised outpatients suffering from a MD women age Â± this T0 relied on an ema protocol involving selfevaluations of seven DS twice a day over months patients did not show any clinical improvement following the clinical screening and the level of depressive symptoms during the followup as a novel finding significant moderate to large effects were observed for decreased variability and instability of psychological states over time the main difference in temporal properties of psychological states was found T3 the first two weeks of the followup this study characterized early changes in patients selfevaluations suggesting the idea of a valuable familiarization period during the first two weeks of an ema followup
EL,erythroleukemia,TS-3737,we have cloned from murine EL mel cells thymus and stomach the cdna encoding the cagated k kca channel mik the mouse homolog of hik ishii t m silvia c hirschberg b bond c t adelman j p and maylie j proc natl acad sciu s a mik mrna was detected at varied C2 in many tissue types mik kca channel activity expressed in xenopus oocytes closely resembled the kca of red cells gardos channel and mel cells in its single channel conductance lack of voltagesensitivity of activation inward rectification and ca concentration dependence mik also resembled the erythroid channel in its pharmacological properties mediating whole cell and unitary currents CS to low nm concentrations of both clotrimazole clt and its desimidazolyl metabolite chlorophenylbisphenylmethanol and to low nm concentrations of iodocharybdotoxin whereas control oocytes subjected to hypotonic swelling remained swollen mik expression conferred on oocytes a novel cadependent cltsensitive RVD response hypotonic swelling of voltageclamped mikexpressing oocytes increased outward currents that were cadependent cltsensitive and reversed near the EK mik mrna levels in es cells increased steadily during erythroid differentiation in SC in contrast to other kca mrnas examined low nanomolar concentrations of clt inhibited proliferation and erythroid differentiation of IP blood stem cells in liquid SC
AML,acute myelogenous leukaemia,TS-3738,a priming dose of CA ara c was given to children and five adults with AML aml to synchronize leukaemia cells in the dna synthesis s phase of the mitotic cycle an infusion of this drug which was continued for h was started at the time of partial synchronization and was repeated every h until the bone marrow was very hypocellular CR remission was achieved in of children and in all adults two of the four children went into pCR with the addition of two doses of daunorubicin or adriamycin these results suggest that partial synchronization of cells in the s phase results in a therapeutic advanatage in the use of ara c for induction of a remission of aml and that manipulation of the mitotic cycle as monitored by kinetic studies may be helpful in planning optimal schedules for drug administration
MPC,methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine,TS-3739,the blood compatibility of a cellulose haemodialysis membrane whose surface was grafted with a methacrylate having a phospholipid polar group MPC was evaluated with attention to platelet adhesion to the membrane surface and complement activation induced by the membrane when the original cellulose membrane came in contact with plateletrich plasma for min numerous platelets adhered to the surface and aggregated on the other hand the membrane grafted with MPC effectively suppressed platelet adhesion and activation this effect became more pronounced with increasing surface CSD especially the methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine grafted CM whose CSD exceeded completely inhibited PLT adhesion even when the contact time was min moreover the complement activation was also reduced with increased MPC distribution on the surface of the membrane
DPP,dipeptidyl peptidase,TS-3740,attractinmahogany protein was previously shown to be involved in a number of physiological and pathological events including IS regulation body weight control pigmentation myelinization and RT susceptibility human attractin has an enzymatic activity resembling DPP iv dppiv in the CE NS attractin has been detected in SN but not in glial cells up to now we show the expression of attractin mrna and protein in glioma cell lines at different degree of transformation in human u and u glioma cells grades iii and iv MB attractin displays hydrolytic activity amounting to and of total cellular dppivlike CEA respectively such activity has not been observed in the rat c glioma cells grade i attractin presence in glioma but not in normal glial cells together with its differential enzymatic activity suggests its role in growth properties of PT of glial cell origin
RG,redgreen,TS-3741,fifty patients aged from to years mean years sd with a uvprotected monofocal polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lens iol were examined with the FM hue fm test and the color vision meter anomaloscope the spectral transmission of the same kind of iols as was used surgically was measured with lambda uvvis spectrometer in the fm test there was no significant difference between the results of the iol eyes and normal eyes however the iol eyes showed better error scores than the normal eyes in the bluepurple box iv in the fm test in the anomaloscope testing the rayleigh RG equation showed no differences between the iol patients and controls in the moreland blue equation however the mid matching point was significantly shifted towards more green meaning better blue colour sensitivity in the iol eyes than in the control eyes this is due to the spectral transmission of the iols which showed transmission already starting at the wavelength of about nm in comparison the transmission of the normal human lens reaches those percentages near nm or even further at advanced age
PL,preferential looking,TS-3742,using a PL methodology with novel verbs gertner fisher and eisengart found that monthold english children seemed to understand the syntactic marking of transitive word order in an abstract verbgeneral way in the current T0 we tested whether young german children of this same age have this same understanding following gertner et al one group of german children was tested only T3 they had received a trainingpractice phase containing transitive sentences with familiar verbs and the exact same nouns as those used at test a second group was tested T3 a trainingpractice phase consisting only of familiar verbs without the nouns used at test only the group of children with the training on full transitive sentences was successful in the test these findings suggest that for children this young to succeed in this test of syntactic understanding they must first have some kind of relevant linguistic experience immediately prior to testingwhich raises the question of the nature of childrens linguistic representations at this early point in OD
PC,phycocyanin,TS-3743,sirolimus was introduced in de novo immunosuppression at stanford university in view of its favorable effects on reduced rejection and CAV T3 an appultures total rna was isolated from all cultures and probed with gene fragments specific to phycocyanin and allophycocyanin subunits and lr the relative level of rnas encoding PC and APC was found to vary with CS intensity in parallel with the phycobiliprotein ratio hence the LH capacity of phycobilisomes is directly regulated by relative C2 of phycobiliprotein mrna the lr transcript occurs as a extension on about of PC transcripts the ratio of rna encoding lr to that encoding phycocyanin did not vary with irradiance although the protein ratio changed to twofold between extremes based on these and other observations we propose that the lr protein is constitutively synthesized at a rate higher than that required to complex with available phycocyanin
SC,sydenhams chorea,TS-3744,SC sc is a neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever autoimmune mechanism of sc is supported by clinical improvement with immunomodulatory therapy presence of circulating serum antibasal ganglia antibodies increase in th group of cytokines in serum and csf of patients however a role of the antibodies in the pathogenesis can only be established by their passive transfer chorea is a manifestation clearly related to increased dopaminergic da activity the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of antibodies from patients with sydenhams chorea to cause SMB alterations on rats with unilateral postsynaptic dopamine receptor upregulation
TI,tindependent,TS-3745,cd ligand cdl plays a crucial role in t celldependent b cell responses but whether its abundance is a limiting factor in their development is unclear this question was addressed in transgenic mice expressing the murine cdl gene under the control of the ilpromoter cdltg the fraction of activated TA from the cdltg mice with detectable levels of surface cdl was modestly greater to fold than littermate controls and paralleled an approximately fold increase in cdl mrna abundance in response to trinitrophenol tnpkeyhole DNP-KLH and tetanusdiphtheria vaccine cdltg mice developed higher titers of highaffinity igg and igg ab than wildtype mice in contrast the ab response of cdltg and control mice was similar in response to the TI ag tnpficoll these results suggest that a modest increment in expression of cdl accelerates the development of tdependent responses and that cdl plays a limiting role in the induction of highaffinity ab and abclass switching
PR,pattern recognition,TS-3746,metabolomic analysis of urinary PAs pas from rat exposed to mhz radiofrequency identification rfid signal for hday for weeks was performed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry as nethoxycarbonylnpentafluoropropionyl derivatives C1 alterations in nine pa C2 including four aliphatic and five acetylated pas were monitored in shamexposed and rfidexposed groups total pa and urinary C2 of n acetylputrescine n acetylcadaverine putrescine cadaverine n acetylspermidine n acetylspermidine spermidine and Sp were reduced whereas n acetylspermine was significantly increased T3 sham and rfid exposure compared with those before exposure their levels were normalized to the corresponding group means before exposure and then plotted into star symbol patterns n acetylspermine after rfid exposure was higher compared to the level before rfid SE while it was elevated by only in the sham group the results suggest that mhz rfid exposure may induce metabolic disturbance of pa it may also elevate spermidinespermine AT ssat activity thus the present metabolic profiling combined with star PR method might be useful for understanding the complexity of PSA events T3 exposure to rfid signal
MA,methyl acrylate,TS-3747,the freeradical dispersion polymerization of MA ma in isododecane was carried out in the presence of a polyethylhexyl acrylate macromolecular raft reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer agent bearing a trithiocarbonate reactive group in the middle of the chain pehattc the presence of the trithiocarbonate CF was crucial for the synthesis of monodisperse colloidal polymethyl acrylate pma particles stabilized by the peha segments the hydrodynamic diameters ranged from to nm using particularly low amounts of the macroraft agent wt vs ma in dispersion polymerizations carried out at wt solids content as shown by d liquid chromatography pehabpma or pehabpmabpeha block copolymers formed in situ at the early stage of the dispersion polymerization due to the reversible transfer process and played the role of particle stabilizer the glasstransition temperature of the derived CP films was not affected by the low amount of the chosen macromolecular stabilizer and the mechanical properties were mainly those of pma which makes the technique very attractive for coating applications
MA,microscopic agglutination,TS-3748,the iberian wolf canis lupus is the top predator in the iberian environments in which it lives FF on a wide range of species thus encountering a wide range of disease agents therefore the wolf can serve as sentinel of environmental contamination with pathogens we investigated the exposure of freeliving wolves to serovars of leptospira interrogans sensu lato kidney samples from wolves collected from in northwestern spain were analysed by SC direct immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction tissue fluids were analysed for antibodies by a MA test ten wolves observed prevalence confidence interval showed evidence of contact with leptospires eight through direct detection and nine through serology wolves were positive according to both techniques titres below the cutoff level were also detected in seven cases serovars confirmed were canicola n icterohaemorrhagiae n and sejroÃ« ballum and grippotyphosa n each indicating that wolves were INF with serovars for which dogs rodents and ungulates are the NK hosts and supporting the utility of the wolf and other C1 predators as environmental sentinels for pathogens
LAP,leucine aminopeptidase,TS-3749,some properties of the intestinal PRs of the rabbitfish were examined at Â°c both TR and chymotrypsin showed ph optima of leucine aminopeptidase however displayed maximum activity in the ph range LAP had the highest optimum temperature Â°c and chymotrypsin the lowest Â°c the optimum temperature of TR was Â°c the activation SE ea was found to be for trypsin and kcal mol for chymotrypsin the ea for LAP was kcal mol above Â°c and kcal mol below Â°c substrate concentrationvelocity plots showed that all three enzymes followed MM kinetics the km and vmax were estimated for the three enzymes the effects of various protease inhibitors on enzyme activity were also examined and confirmed the protease classes to which each enzyme belonged the three proteases examined have similar properties to PRs in other fishes
HOS,human osteosarcoma cell line,TS-3750,a pertussis toxinsensitive g protein has been reported to play a role in the mitogenic response to insulinlike growth factori igfi in mouse fibroblasts and diacylglycerol generation has been shown to accompany growth stimulation by igfi of several cell lines we have examined the roles of pertussis toxin CS g proteins and diacylglycerol generation in signaling by the insulinlike growth factori receptor in a cell line that is very responsive to igfi the HOS mg pertussis toxin failed to inhibit igfi induced hthymidine incorporation into dna furthermore the SD analog gtp gamma s had no effect on the binding of ilabelled igfi to mg membrane preparations following addition of igfi to growtharrested mg cells there was no increase in diacylglycerol levels over min we conclude that the activated igfi receptor does not use pertussis toxin sensitive g proteins or diacylglycerol generation in a pathway leading to dna synthesis in mg cells
ST,saturation transfer,TS-3751,altered tissue temperature andor ph is a common feature in pathological conditions where metabolic demand exceeds oxygen supply such as in PT and following stroke therefore in vivo tissue temperature and ph may become valuable biomarkers for disease detection and the monitoring of disease progression or treatment response in conditions with altered metabolic demand in this T0 ph is measured using the amide protons of a thulium tm complex with a dotamglycinelysine ligand tmdotamglylys the ph was uniquely determined from the linewidth of the asymmetry curve of the chemical exchange ST spectrum independent of UCA concentration or temperature for a given saturation pulse ph maps with an interpixel sigma of less than ph units were obtained in mm tmdotamglylys solutions with ph ranging from to ph units at Â°c temperature maps were simultaneously obtained using the CS of the chemical exchange ST peak temperature and ph maps are demonstrated in the mouse leg n where the mean and sigma for ph was Â± ph unit and temperature was Â± Â°c
PE,pulmonary emboli,TS-3752,a yearold woman with hypertension diabetes hypothyroidism and chronic renal failure reported to the hospital for her regularly scheduled hemodialysis complaining of shortness of breath despite fluid removal during her hemodialysis she remained tachypneic and developed stridor she was admitted to the hospital for a workup of a known mediastinal mass thought to be a goiter however she deteriorated over the next several hours and expired a postmortem examination confirmed fatal PE this case illustrates the fact that while most patients with chronic renal failure are considered to be at low risk for pulmonary emboli it is often not diagnosed when present in this paper we will review the epidemiological data supporting this notion examine proposed pathophysiological mechanisms and review the diagnostic RPA that should be considered in the setting of chronic renal failure

HF,highflux,TS-3781,several of the Th1 pathways that are activated in patients during dialysis have the potential of producing many SE these occur three times a week accompanying dialysis and are particularly intense in patients dialysed with socalled bioincompatible CM despite the proven biological superiority of biocompatible membranes we lack definitive evidence that complement and cell activation three times a week over a period of years is detrimental to patients because the results of prospective randomized studies are conflicting although they do not lead to a decrease in acute clinical PS epidemiological studies suggest that semisynthetic and synthetic membranes may reduce morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients further large scale prospective and randomized trials with a long followup are needed in order to clarify the clinical effects of biocompatibility per se the increasingly recognized clinical importance of HF treatments and the possible interaction between biocompatibility and membrane flux
ASA,acetylsalicylate,TS-3782,arbaprostil is an orally AS prostaglandin e analogue it has been developed as a drug to treat ulcers induced by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in this study pharmacokinetic interactions between arbaprostil and aspirin were examined in humans T3 chronic doses of both drugs subjects received either arbaprostil micrograms aspirin mg or arbaprostil micrograms and aspirin mg four times a day for days and one dose on th day blood and urine samples were collected after the last dose for h pharmacokinetic parameters of arbaprostil aspirin and salicylate were determined coadministration of arbaprostil significantly lowered the area under curve micrograms hml vs micrograms hml mean se p less than and time h vs h p less than to reach maximal plasma concentration of aspirin ASA the pharmacokinetics of salicylate were not changed by arbaprostil nor were the pharmacokinetics of arbaprostil affected by aspirin coadministration of these two drugs did not appear to potentiate the sideeffects of either drug the results suggest that arbaprostil and aspirin may be po together without clinically significant changes in pharmacokinetics or adverse sideeffects
VR,ventilation rate,TS-3783,to investigate the effect of VR on respiratory mechanics neonates ventilated in the neonatal period for various reasons were studied while being ventilated at and breathsmin dynamic respiratory system elasticity ers dynamic Rrs rrs and AM pressure at end expiration eep were calculated by using multilinear regression to fit the equation of motion of a linear singlecompartment MM technically satisfactory data were obtained from neonates with the fast ventilation rate tidal volume and rrs decreased by a mean of p and p respectively ers and eep increased by a mean of p and p respectively fast ventilation produced a shorter effective TC during expiration limiting the changes in eep and hence in endexpiratory lung volume the same changes in respiratory mechanics were also observed in neonates who did not show an increase in eep even at high frequency these neonates had a high elastance and time constant short enough to ensure adequate lung emptying these results suggest that the respiratory mechanics of ventilated neonates are frequency dependent and that neonates with higher ers such as those with hyaline TMD can cope with fast rate ventilation without developing dynamic hyperinflation

LE,life events,TS-3786,previous studies show that early LE result in neurobehavioural alterations that may be either beneficial or detrimental to the AS response given the close relationship between corticosterone secretion and mnemonic processes the purpose of the present T0 was to investigate the effects of brief bms min and long maternal separations lms min on SM tasks in AD rats assessed by context and tone fear conditioning at adulthood males were evaluated for behavioural and hormonal reaction to the training environment being tested for context fear conditioning tone fear conditioning and learning curve in the context fear conditioning in which rats were daily reexposed to the context followed by a brief footshock and in the last day of the experiment day animals were exposed to the context corticosterone and acth plasma levels were determined in naÃ¯ve rats basal or or min T3 each test peak acth and corticosterone levels were similar among the CG T3 context CFC however levels of ctl rats remained elevated for a longer time in the learning curve of context CFC both bms and lms rats exhibited less freezing behaviour than ctl rats without differences in hormone secretion there was neither an association between activity of the hpa axis and performance on memory tasks nor different activational properties of the tasks on the hpa axis between bms and lms rats ie both manipulations lead to similar performance in hippocampusdependent and independent SM tasks
WT,inhibitor wortmannin,TS-3787,density measurements were carried out for aqueous solutions of two cationic surfactants dodecylethyldimethylammonium bromide cedmab and benzyldimethyldodecylammonium bromide bddab on the basis of the obtained results of the measurements the cmc and partial molar volumes of the surfactants studied were also determined the obtained cmc values were also analyzed with those accounted on the basis of the surface tension data from the previous paper j harkot b jaÅ\x84czuk j colloid interface sci submitted for publication the values of cmc determined from the surface tension and density measurements for cedmab are equal to x and x m and for bddab to x and x m respectively these obtained values are very similar however in the literature it is difficult to find the cmc values for cedmab and bddab determined by these two methods used by usespecially from the density measurements for bddab and surface tension measurements for cedmab in the case of the apparent molar volumes of cedmab there is a good PA between the values obtained by us and those found in the literature the cmc values for cedmab and bddab were also determined on the basis of their surface tension and free SE of electrostatic interactions between the polar heads of these surfactants and compared with those obtained from the surface tension and density measurements it was found that the theoretically obtained cmc values were close to those determined from the density and surface tension data for the cedmab and that the ratios of the cmc values of the surfactants to their concentration at which the water surface tension decreased by about mnm proved that the presence of the aryl group in the bddab head instead of the methyl group caused that its micellization process was more inhibited lation of pten and the subsequent activation of akt we have additionally shown that inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol triphosphate kinase pikakt pathway by the specific WT induced a significant potentiation of susceptibility of g and icam si rnatreated TA to ctlinduced lysis the present T0 shows that a shift in icam expression which was associated with an activation of the pikakt pathway can be used by metastatic melanoma cells to escape ctlmediated killing
PE,pericardial effusion,TS-3788,the danger of CT occurring when pericarditis is accompanied by PE as opposed merely to the presence of a friction rub without effusion has been unclear forty patients on hemodialysis were studied by PE chest xray film and echocardiography for evidence of pericarditis and PE only two patients developed a friction rub during the T0 and were placed on regional heparin ten of patients who were positive on echocardiogram for pericardial effusion had unremarkable PCS examinations these patients had cardiomegaly as noted on chest xray examination eighteen of patients without effusion also had cardiomegaly on chest xray film no patient remaining on SVR heparin and having a pericardial effusion developed cardiovascular complications during hemodialysis this study suggests that while many patients on longterm hemodialysis have pericardial effusion undiagnosed on the basis of PE but noted on echocardiogram special precautions to prevent tamponade during hemodialysis are not necessary also posterioranterior chest xray film showing a normalsized heart will usually exclude significant PE
NS,nonsignificant,TS-3789,prostatitis and sexually transmitted diseases stds have been positively associated with prostate CA in previous casecontrol studies however results from recent prospective studies have been inconclusive methodogyprincipal findings we investigated the association between prostatitis stds and prostate CA among african american asian american latino and white participants of the california mens health T0 our analysis included men who completed a detailed baseline questionnaire in we identified incident prostate CA cases during the followup period to june cox PH models were used to estimate relative risks and confidence intervals overall men having a history of prostatitis had an increased risk of prostate CA than men with no history rr ci longer duration of prostatitis symptoms was also associated with an increased risk of prostate CA p trend in addition among men screened for prostate cancer or psa tests a NS positive association was observed between prostatitis and prostate CA rr ci stds were not associated with overall prostate CA risk in racialethnic stratified analysis latinos reporting any stds had an increased risk of disease than those with no stds rr ci interestingly foreignborn latinos displayed a larger risk associated with stds rr ci than us born latinos rr ci
CST,corticospinal tract,TS-3790,acute traumatic central cord syndrome has been classically thought to be caused by a hemorrhage that primarily affects the central part of the spinal cord and that destroys the axons of the inner part of the CST devoted to the motor control of the hands some authors however have proposed that its pathogenesis is based on the destruction of the motor SN supplying the muscles of the hand to test the validity of these two theories the authors retrospectively studied the magnetic resonance mr images obtained in cases of acute traumatic CCS atccs to assess the presence of intramedullary blood and to define the distribution of the abnormal signal intensities in the cervical spinal cord
TSA,typespecific antigen,TS-3791,various techniques have been utilized for antigen solubilization isolation and purification this report is the first to describe the isolation and purification of a typespecific antigen from chlamydia trachomatis serotype a grown in CC the TSA was prepared from CT trachomatis serotype a organisms grown in baby hamster kidney cells bhk the SE process employed a combination of both ph change and triton x solubilization the soluble extract was radioiodinated and subjected to ion exchange and GF chromatography the fractions eluted were tested for type specificity utilizing the igg prepared from exhaustively crossabsorbed hyperimmune sera from rabbits immunized with homologous organisms molecular shift chromatography was employed for analysis small samples of the isolated antigen were later used as markers for preparation of larger quantities necessary for antigenic characterization the purified typespecific antigen has a mw of to
SB,single bond,TS-3792,the possible reaction mechanism of atomic radical f with propene is investigated theoretically by a detailed potential SE surface pes calculation at the umpgdp and ccsdtccpvtz singlepoint levels using ab initio quantum chemistry methods and transitionstate theory various possible reaction paths including additionisomerizationelimination reactions and direct hatom abstraction reactions are considered among them the most feasible pathway should be the atomic radical f f attacking on the c formula see text c double bond in propene chch formula see text ch to form a weakly bound complex i with no barrier followed by atomic radical f addition to the c formula see text c double bond to form the lowlying intermediate isomer barrierlessly starting from intermediate isomer the most competitive reaction pathway is the dissociation of the cc SB via transition state tsp leading to the product p ch chf formula see text ch however in the direct hatom abstraction reactions the atomic radical f picking up the ballylic hydrogen of propene barrierlessly is the most feasible pathway from thermodynamic consideration the other reaction pathways on the doublet pes are less competitive because of thermodynamical or kinetic AF no additionelimination mechanism exists on the potential energy surface because the intermediates and transition states involved in the major pathways are all lower than the reactants in SE the title reaction is expected to be rapid furthermore on the basis of the analysis of the kinetics of all channels through which the addition and abstraction reactions proceed we expect that the competitive SP of reaction channels may vary with exp conditions for the title reaction the present study may be helpful for probing the mechanisms of the title reaction and understanding the halogen chemistry
SC,c disease,TS-3793,we measured antibodies to HC virus hcv in patients with various liver diseases by three ELISAs elisas hcv antibody elisa test c kcl kcl corresponding to the nonstructural protein of hcv and jcc based on the translation product of the presumptive hcv core gene of cases of nona nonb nanb MLD were antic positive were antikcl positive and were antijcc positive detection of SS hcvrna in cases of chronic nanb liver disease revealed that the concordance was for c for kcl for jcc and for all three elisas overall of chronic nanb cases were considered to have type SC with hcv infection the most reliable assays for diagnosing chronic nanb MLD as type c appeared to be the kcl and jcc elisas
SF,shortening fraction,TS-3794,murine models are increasingly used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms contributing to left VVI lv remodeling epidemiologic and animal studies have suggested that women undergo differing patterns of lv CR than men after myocardial infarction mi we therefore sought to compare lv remodeling T3 mi in male and female mice echocardiography was performed in male and female cbl mice before and serially after mi two days T3 mi EDV lv internal diameter and SF were similar in males and females between days and after mi lv internal diameter increased in male mice but remained unchanged in female mice during this time period SF declined in males but not in females PW thickness increased more in females than in males the size of the mi and the lv massbody weight were similar between the sexes after mi echocardiography showed that T3 mi female mice undergo less extensive lv CR than males with less dilation and better preserved lv systolic function days T3 mi these sex differences should be taken into account when studying murine cardiac adaptation to mi
LM,longitudinal muscle,TS-3795,the antibiotic BC x x m increase the inhibition of the contractile response caused by both enkephalin release and direct application of metenkephalin x m in the LM strip preparation from guineapig ileum this effect is attributed to an inhibition of enkephalin degrading peptidases by bacitracin
LE,left ear,TS-3796,LE suppression to dichotically presented verbal stimuli has been observed in patients with multiple sclerosis ms rubens and coworkers have suggested that a disconnection of the auditory callosal pathways may account for this finding to examine this proposal we compared the performance of ms patients with significant corpus callosum atrophy cca on midsagittal magnetic resonance scans ms patients without significant cca and demographically matched NCs on two laterality tasks verbal DL consonantvowel syllables and tachistiscopic objectnaming RL results indicated that LE suppression was found only in the ms patients with cca likewise patients in the ms group with cca were slow in responding to stimuli presented in the left visual field this effect was not observed in patients without cca these findings support the hypothesis that efficiency of crosscallosal information flow is reduced in ms patients with cca
PI,principal investigator,TS-3797,this study was aimed at determining risk AF associated to depression in pregnancy andor the puerperium by means of both observerrated and selfrated scales a expectant mother sample was assessed by the coinvestigators interviewed by the PI later on the PAS was used to obtain an rdc diagnosis the same procedure was repeated to months T3 delivery a greater SE to life events prior consultation for emotional problems as well as economic difficulties arising of late were all associated to depression in pregnancy and the puerperium getting separated from significant persons in a womans life andor difficult relationships with either husband or mother have been strongly associated to depression at both periods as regards puerperium depression several associations directly related to childbirth having had a lowweight baby or the PN period lactation problems were detected anxiety and depressive symptoms during pregnancy have been also clearly linked to PPD the predictive value of such risk AF is discussed it is suggested that questions on these AF should be included into ordinary health assessments of both pregnant and puerperal women
EF,external fixation,TS-3798,EF for pelvic stabilization is an important component of the overall treatment of patients with highenergy pelvic fractures traditional constructs include single and multiple pin placements in several locations in each IC biomechanical and anatomic studies have focused on pin placement lower on the pelvis specifically in the supraacetabular region pins in this location are more SD biomechanically allow for pelvic reduction in the transverse plane of deformity facilitate concurrent or subsequent LAP procedures and may allow improved reduction of the posterior elements with a femoral distractor as a compressor we describe the technique for placement of supraacetabular external fixation pins pelvic reduction and compression using a FA distractor
SP,subplate,TS-3799,the human and mouse cripto cr genes can code for proteins related in structure to epidermal growth factor egf a TPS kda immunoreactive protein was detected by western blot analysis in human cell lines that express cr mrna but not in cell lines that fail to express this transcript immunoprecipitation of geo Caco-2 or F9 cells detected kda and kda proteins respectively cell lysates and CS medium that were prepared from several cho clones and were expressing either a recombinant human or mouse cr cdna contained immunospecific kda and kda proteins respectively monensin or tunicamycunosummoleculare disappeared at PN stages at ee smiimmunoreactive SF were observed in the developing VWM SP and outer MZ which suggests that these layers are CS of early synaptogenesis at pp smi immunoreactivity became homogeneously distributed within the hippocampal layers the present results show that neurons in the hippocampal subplate and marginal zones have a more precocious morphological and neurochemical differentiation than the SN residing in the principal cell layers it is suggested that these early maturing neurons may have a role in the targeting of HPC afferents as subplate cells do in the developing neocortex
MV,maedivisna,TS-3800,the results of serological testing for maedivisna virus infection in indigenous and nonindigenous sheep in NI over a five year period to are presented in tests carried out in and on pedigree breeds reactors were identified on seven farms and maedivisna virus was isolated on three occasions from leucocyte cultures none of the animals showed clinical signs of MV and all the reactors were subsequently destroyed nine of the reactors were imports from scotland or the republic of ireland and the other was the progeny of an imported ewe in subsequent tests to of exotic and indigenous flocks no further reactors were identified a survey of goat herds for evidence of caprine arthritisencephalitis virus infection was also negative
SM,sternomastoid,TS-3801,the segmental and topographical organization of motoneurons of the spinal accessory nerve was studied in monkeys with horseradish peroxidase hrp the SM muscle is innervated primarily from the cc level of the cord and the motor column is medial in the VH the trapezius muscle however is innervated primarily from the ccc levels of the cord and the motor column lies in the VL region of the VP horn the data are discussed with regard to treatment of torticollis
SC,sigmoid colon,TS-3802,using a data base of acute abdominal pains we have described the assessed clinical features of acute diverticulitis of the SC percentages of sensitivities have been replaced by adverbs or adjectives applying a scale of equivalence the modifications of the positive predictive values have been also replaced by verbs or typical expressions in this article abscesses fistulas generalized peritonitis and hemorrhage arising from an acute diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon were not studied
CSE,crosssectional echocardiography,TS-3803,a year old patient with recurrent atrial fibrillation and atypical angina was found to have hypertrophic nonobstructive apical cardiomyopathy his electrocardiogram recorded left VVI hypertrophy and giant inverted t waves CSE revealed a typical aceofspade configuration of the left VVI apex this feature was confirmed at cardiac catheterization which failed however to detect any intraventricular pressure gradient even after isoproterenol infusion the apex of the right ventricle was also obliterated by hypertrophied muscle thus this case had all the typical findings of HCM nonobstructive apical cardiomyopathy which were best displayed by electrocardiography bidimensional echocardiography and LVG
GA,geographic atrophy,TS-3804,GA ga of the RPE rpe is a devastating complication of agerelated macular degeneration amd ga may be classified as drusenrelated drusenassociated ga or neovascularizationrelated neovascularassociated ga drusenrelated ga remains a C1 public health concern due to the burden of blindness it produces but pathophysiology of the condition is obscure and there are no proven treatment options genotyping cell biology and clinical imaging point to upregulation of parainflammatory pathways oxidative stress and choroidal sclerosis as contributors among other AF onset and monitoring of progression is accomplished through clinical imaging instrumentation such as OCT photography and autofluorescence which are the tools most helpful in determining end points for PCTs at present a number of treatment approaches with diverse targets are in development at this time some of which are in human clinical trials neovascularassociated ga is a consequence of rpe loss T3 development of neovascular amd the neovascular process leads to a plethora of cellular stresses such as ischemia inflammation and dramatic changes in cell environment that further taxes rpe cells already dysfunctional from drusenassociated changes ga may therefore develop AA to the neovascular process de novo or preexisting drusenassociated ga may continue to worsen with the OD of neovascular amd neovascularassociated ga is a prominent cause of continued vision loss in patients with otherwise successfully treated neovascular amd clearly treatment with VE growth factor vegf inhibitors early in the course of the neovascular disease is of great clinical benefit however there is a rationale and some suggestive evidence that antivegf agents themselves could be toxic to rpe and enhance neovascularassociated ga the increasing prevalence of legal blindness from this condition due to the aging of the GP lends urgency to the search for a therapy to ameliorate ga
SE,southeast,TS-3805,studies of zircon grains using optical microscopy microraman spectroscopy and SEM microscopy sem have been carried out to characterize the surface of NK zircon as a function of etching time according to the surface characteristics observed using an optical microscope after etching the zircon grains were classified as i homogeneous ii anomalous and iii hybrid microraman results showed that as etching time increases the crystal lattice is slightly altered for homogeneous grains it is CR damaged for anomalous grains and it is altered in some Az for hybrid grains the sem SE dispersive xray spectroscopy eds results indicated that independent of the grain types where the crystallinity remains after etching the chemical composition of zircon is approximately sio zro standard natural zircon and for Az where the grain does not have a crystalline structure there are variations of zro and mainly sio in addition it is possible to observe a uniform surface density of fission tracks in grain areas where the determined crystal lattice and chemical composition are those of zircon regarding hybrid grains we discuss whether the areas slightly altered by the chemical etching can be analyzed by the fission track method ftm or not results of zircon fission track and upb dating show that hybrid and homogeneous grains can be used for dating and not only homogeneous grains more than sedimentary samples from the bauru basin SE brazil were analyzed and show that only a small amount of grains are homogeneous questioning the validity of the rest of the grains for thermochronological evolution studies using zircon ftm dating
SP,seropositive,TS-3806,this report describes border disease in a flock of sheep in switzerland in april three ewes in a flock of sheep gave birth to lambs that had generalized tremors and excessively hairy fleece one of these a threeweekold female lamb was referred to our clinic for further diagnostic workup the lamb was very nervous bleated constantly and had generalized muscle tremors which were more pronounced in the head region hind end ataxia was observed and the lamb was slow to correct its posture when the hind limbs were abducted adducted or crossed blood samples were collected every six weeks to determine antibody titres to pestivirus and for virus isolation via cell culture a skin biopsy sample was also collected and examined immunohistochemically for pestivirus antigen antibody titres in the first tests were suspicious and those of the second were negative pestivirus was identified in cell culture and the skin biopsy sample was positive for pestivirus antigen blood samples were collected from all of the ewes and lambs and the buck for virus isolation via cell culture and determination of pestivirus antibody titres thirtyone animals were SP six had borderline antibody titres and four were seronegative pestivirus was isolated from eight animals which included the lamb described in this report of the viruspositive animals three were seronegative three others had borderline titres and two were SP six of the eight viruses isolated from cell culture were further characterized genetically via retrotranscription and polymerase chain reaction and subsequent sequencing the phylogenetic analysis revealed that the causative agent was border disease virus this is the first time that border disease virus has been isolated in switzerland the lamb referred to our clinic was observed for three months it was then euthanatised and a postmortem examination was performed immunohistochemical examination of numerous organs revealed pestivirus antigen the source of infection was though to be infected sheep from another flock which shared a pasture all antigenpositive animals were slaughtered
AOD,alcohol and other drug,TS-3807,in this article we seek to delineate the experiences of contraceptive use by australian women living with hepatitis c using semistructured indepth interviews women with hepatitis c from two cities in australia melbourne victoria and canberra the australian capital territory were interviewed about their AOD use their contraceptive history and their experiences of hepatitis c we aimed to understand why such a high proportion of women living with SH c had previously reported that they were not currently using contraception many women had used contraception at some stage of their lives but were no longer using it because they had experienced contraceptive failure or uncomfortable side effects others were concerned about the impact of contraception on their fertility were planning to get pregnant or considered themselves to be celibate HC appeared to have little impact on their contraceptive practices but some womens illicit drug use had an important influence illicit drug use was for some an encouragement to seek LT forms of contraception that reduced their chances of pregnancy while for others drug taking hampered their contraceptive use in compliance with HP campaigns of the last two decades women were generally more concerned about preventing sexually transmissible infections than pregnancies particularly with new or casual partners
BSM,bovine submaxillary mucin,TS-3808,with dimethyl sulphoxide instead of butanol in the thiobarbituric acid CA for sialic acid a nonfading chromophore with lambdamax nm was produced in a homogeneous solution allowing dilution of the test mixture in case of high colour yield this test adapted well to studies on alkaline deoacetylation bovine and rat submaxillary mucins and rabbit TH urinary sialoproteins contain oacetyl isomers of neuramine acid that are resistant to the thiobarbituric acid CA alkaline deoacetylation converted resistant oacetylneuraminic acid into thiobarbituric acidreactive sialic acid and such conversion paralleled deoacetylation as measured by the ferric hydroxamate method the colour increment was similar when the alkaline treatment of BSM either preceded or followed the acid hydrolysis only alkaline preptreatment was effective with rat submaxillary mucin by selecting optimal conditions for ALP deoacetylation oacetyl isomers can be accurately assessed by the thiobarbituric acid CA
AS,angiosarcoma,TS-3809,angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive vascular malignancy with a poor prognosis there is no standard chemotherapy regime for advanced angiosarcoma here we report a case of T3 angiosarcoma that was successfully treated with apatinib an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the ICD of VE growth factor receptor vegfr to our knowledge this is the first case to report the successful use of apatinib for AS furthermore the administration of apatinib results in fewer toxic effects than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed high expression of vegfr mrna suggesting that apatinib leads to clinical response by inhibiting vegfr tyrosine kinase activity and that vegfr plays a crucial role for AS apatinib may be an additional option for angiosarcoma especially for the aged and patients with poor performance status further prospective studies are required to optimize the use of apatinib in patients with angiosarcoma and to identify which patients will benefit from the agent
HT,hypertensive patients,TS-3810,obesity is a risk factor for arterial hypertension type diabetes and cardiovascular diseases some studies reported an obesity paradox obese patients with cardiovascular diseases have better prognosis than patients with body mass index bmi kgm the objective of the study was to identify the differences between the clinical characteristics of obese hypertensive patients with chronic ischemic HR disease in comparison with lean HT with chronic ICM HR disease
PG,plakoglobin,TS-3811,during the last few years considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the structure and CF of cadherins and of the pathophysiology of pemphigus cadherins are a multiple gene family of cadependent CAMs with a typical singlespanning TM structure cadherins have two L1 subfamilies classic cadherin and desmosomal cadherin classic cadherins including e p and ncadherins are characterized by a homophilic IB specificity they localize at adherens junctions and mediate physiologic interaction with the involvement of cytoplasmic anchoring molecules catenins and the actinbased cytoskeleton network desmosomal cadherins the desmocollins and desmogleins localize at desmosomes and are linked to the intermediate keratin filaments network via PG and desmoplakin molecular cloning has demonstrated that the autoantigens of both PV and pemphigus foliaceus are members of the desmoglein subfamily of the cadherin supergene family thus pemphigus is characterized as an anticadherin autoimmune disease furthermore a BV recombinant protein of pemphigus vulgaris antigen was capable of absorbing out the pathogenic autoantibodies from patients sera providing a possibility of antigenspecific therapeutic strategies for pemphigus
GI,gastroenterology,TS-3812,based on the location of training programs internal applicants and local applicants were defined as applicants who attended the same training institution and TR in local areas ie state division and region respectively while being an internal applicant does influence fellowship matching success for some specialties GI fellowship program directors do not rank this consideration in the top half of their priority list there is no published evidence about the frequency that internal applicants and local applicants match in us gastroenterology training program
PT,pretectum,TS-3813,the study of the saccadic system has focused mainly on SN AS before the beginning of saccades in order to determine their contribution in movement planning and execution however most oculomotor structures contain also SN whose activity starts only T3 the ON of saccades the maximum of their activity sometimes occurring near saccade end their characteristics are still largely unknown we investigated pretectal SN with saccaderelated activity in the alert cat during eye movements towards a moving target they emitted a highfrequency burst of action potentials T3 the onset of saccades irrespective of their direction and will be referred to as pretectal saccaderelated neurons the delay between saccade ON and cell activity varied from to ms on average we found that burst parameters were correlated with the parameters of saccades the peak eye velocity was correlated with the peak of the spike density CF the saccade amplitude with the number of spikes in the burst and burst duration increased with saccade duration the activity of six pretectal saccaderelated neurons was studied during SP at different velocities a rho was found between smooth pursuit velocity and mean firing rate a minority of these SN were also visually responsive their visual activity was proportional to the difference between eye and target velocity during SP retinal slip these results indicate that the activity of pretectal saccaderelated SN is correlated with the characteristics of eye movements this finding is in agreement with the known anatomical projections from premotor regions of the saccadic system to the PT
CLP,cleft lip and palate,TS-3814,if the primary palatal closure in a patient with CLP is unsuccessful defects such as palatal fistulas and a short velum have to be corrected by AA operations it is an informal belief among surgeons that these reoperations can have detrimental effects on the patients nasal resonance and articulation it was our aim to critically evaluate the validity of this belief
CR,coronary risk,TS-3815,wellknown CR factors such as hyperlipidemia hypertension smoking and diabetes are reported to induce the oxidative stress under the oxidative stress lowdensity lipoprotein ldl is oxidatively modified in the vasculature and formed oxidized ldl induces EC dysfunction expression of adhesion molecules and apoptosis of V1 smooth muscle cells it has become evident that these cellular responses induced by Ox ldl are mediated by lectinlike oxidized ldl receptor lox lox was originally identified from cultured aortic endothelial cells as a receptor for Ox ldl however recent investigations revealed that lox has diverse roles in the hostdefense system and inflammatory responses and it is involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases such as atherosclerosisbased cardiovascular diseases and SS beside oxidized ldl lox recognizes multiple ligands including apoptotic cells platelets advanced glycation end products bacteria and heat shock proteins hsps the hsps CF as a chaperone to affect protein folding of newly synthesized or denatured proteins there are accumulating evidences that the hsps released into the extracellular space have potent biological activities and it may work as a kind of cytokines it is demonstrated that lox works as a receptor for hsp since it has high affinity for hsp the interaction of lox with hsp is involved in the crosspresentation of antigen given the potent and wide variety of biological MICs more understanding their interaction provides potential therapeutic strategy for various human diseases
AM,adrenal medulla,TS-3816,in this review the experimental BG for treatment of patients with FPD by intracerebral transplantation is presented IC transplantation has been performed either with the patients own AM or with human fetal DA neurons obtained from abortions IC transplantation of adrenal BCC to rodents has shown poor cell survival and minor transient effects on experimentally induced parkinsonlike PS intracerebral autotransplants of medullary adrenal tissue to patients with parkinsons disease have shown corresponding minor improvements in the parkinson status animal experiments with grafting of developing fetal DA neurons have been more rewarding and resulted in reversal of parkinsonlike PS experimental transplantations with human fetal dopaminergic SN to patients with FPD have not entirely lived up to these expectations at a recent meeting arranged to set up a european network for research and information it was agreed that more animal experiments in particular including nonhuman primates are needed regarding the PCTs with transplantation of human fetal dopaminergic tissue coordination of neurological test procedures performed pre and posttransplantation was strongly recommended
NB,nitrobenzene,TS-3817,both clinical experience and epidemiological studies in community and specialized eg treatment populations indicate that the prevalence of couse of alcohol and cocaine anects when po subchronically six of these chemicals boric acid dinoseb hexanedione methoxychlor metronidazole ornidazole produced substantial spermatotoxicity T3 to doses spermatotoxic effects of chlordimeform were equivocal while ppddt nhexane and sodium chlorite were judged negative four chemicals with known acute effects benomyl busulfan EG monomethyl ether NB elicited expected histopathologic responses T3 a single dose testicular histology testicular sperm head counts cauda sperm counts sperm morphology and sperm velocity proved to be the most toxicologically CS endpoints in one or more of the studies but histopathology of the testis and epididymis was the most consistent indicator of reproductive damage the percentage of motile sperm and sperm concentration in the epididymal fluid were the least CS measurements the data suggested that most chemicals with the potential to produce moderate to severe sperm damage are detectable with a short duration test complementary multiple endpoints enhanced the interpretation of results often identified cellular targets and provided insight on possible mechanisms specific responses were often similar to TPS effects reported for subchronic exposures a short duration test could be of value as a screen in structureactivity studies or to set priorities for chemicals requiring further DUE as a supplement to breeding studies the data generated in the short test could also be used to enhance the design and interpretation of the longer tests
CC,corpus callosum,TS-3818,the temporal order of the myelination of the nervous pathways in dayold wistar rats was quantitatively analyzed using immunohistochemistry with antimyelin basic protein mbp antibody immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffinembedded tissue according to the standard abc technique for the objective DUE of myelination we converted the level stained with the immunohistochemical method into continuous numbers of giving the intensity of myelination using an image analyzing system we analyzed nine nervous pathways CC optic tract internal capsule spinal tract of trigeminal nerve VPI cerebellar peduncle cerebellar VWM PT MLF and cuneate fasciculus the ON of the myelination of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve inferior cerebellar peduncle medial longitudinal fasciculus and cuneate fasciculus was day postnatal that of the corpus callosum OT IC and cerebellar white matter was day and that of the pyramidal tract was day the time required to reach the level of myelination of day was day for the spinal tract of the TG nerve and the VPI cerebellar peduncle day for the IC day for the corpus callosum optic tract cerebellar white matter and pyramidal tract and day for the MLF our method using immunohistochemistry with antimbp antibody provided a highly sensitive and objective criterion for judging precisely the time and the progress of myelination in each nervous pathway and compare one nervous pathway with another
CM,chronic migraine,TS-3819,patients with CM cm have high frequence of psychiatric comorbidity or psychological distress the presence of depression anxiety panic or obsessive disorders in these patients contributes to poor quality of life and can influence prognosis and treatment a systematic investigation of psychiatric comorbidity is needed in patients with cm especially in those with medication overuse mo in order to reach a more comprehensive clinical management we assessed the psychological profile of patients women and men suffering from cm with mo the spectrum project a cDNA way of describing and assessing psychopathology with structured clinical interviews was used for the psychological DUE of the patients to explore personality traits spectrum instruments mood disorders moods panic agoraphobic disorders pas and obsessivecompulsive disorder obs were applied to study patients obsquestionnaire was positive in of the patients moodsquestionnaire in pasquestionnaire in on patients presented positivity to or to all questionnaires in VL associations none of the patients of the studied group had complete normal findings in the questionnaires clinical records of patients with obsquestionnaire positivity showed a worse clinical course and tendency to relapse these results suggest that psychological assessment is an essential step in the evaluation and treatment of patients with cm and mo the remarkable percentage of obsquestionnaire positivity in this group indicates that obsessivecompulsive trait represents besides depression and anxiety a L1 risk of chronification and overusing

CS,chemical shift,TS-3821,two models a and b have been proposed to account for decreased downfield delta of a proton bound by noncovalent interactions at a ligandantibiotic interface as the number of ligandantibiotic interactions is decreased in model a the proton involved in the noncovalent bond suffers a smaller downfield shift because the bond is with a relatively C1 probability broken and not because it is longer in model b the proton involved in the noncovalent bond suffers a smaller downfield shift because the bond is longer and not because it is with a relatively large probability broken we show that MM a cannot account for the CS changes MM b accounts for the process of positively cooperative IB in which noncovalent bonds are reduced in length and thereby increase the stability of the organized state
CT,critical thinking,TS-3822,problembased learning pbl has been implemented in the dental hygiene program at the university of hong kong since but research is lacking to address the level of retention in the workplace the purpose of this T0 was to explore whether dental hygienists continue to use their pbl skills and how well those skills are being applied in the workplace a total of eighteen dental hygienists from the program were invited to participate in this T0 a survey was conducted and followup group interviews carried out in the results revealed that dental hygienists continue to use the pbl skills of communication with the patient patient education and independent learning but seldom use dental knowledge teamwork and communication with colleagues CT selfevaluation and lifelong learning skills showed contradictory results besides stressors under individual work environments including certain chinese cultural values affect the way in which dental hygienists utilize pbl skills this study concludes that the pbl approach is a worthwhile learning process for dental hygiene however many different variables affect the effectiveness of applying pbl skills after academic training especially under the influence of chinese culture in hong kong
TR,texas red,TS-3823,intrapericardial application of therapeutic agents may open perspectives for targetdirected therapy of the diseased heart this study was performed to investigate whether intrapericardial drug application is beneficial from a pharmacokinetic point of view male wistar rats were provided with intrapericardial and intravascular catheters for substance administration and sampling intrapericardial bolus i.v. of fluorescent macromolecules fluorescein isothiocyanate fitcrat igg molecular weight about kda texas red rat SS Al mol wt kda TR FB growth factor fgf mol wt kda and fitc heparin mean mol wt kda resulted in substance concentrations in pericardial fluid that exceeded those in plasma for several hours pericardial fluid volumes of catheterinstrumented rats derived from initial V1 volumes ranged between and mlkg T3 chronic days intrapericardial infusions with osmotic minipumps pericardial fluidplasma concentration ratios local advantages were to for the FL proteins and for fitcheparin this can be explained by the low substance clearances in pericardial fluid compared with plasma local advantages of the small substances cortisol mol wt and a carbonic acid derivative thereof mol wt were and intrapericardial infusion of ifgf yielded times higher cardiac tissue C2 than systemic infusion whereas ifgf was found in the entire HR pharmacokinetic profiles of intrapericardially applied substances are such that desired local drug concentrations can be obtained at lower dosages whereas SVR concentrations remain low thus reducing the potential risk of peripheral side effects therefore intrapericardial application of therapeutic agents provides a promising strategy for sitespecific treatment of HR or coronary diseases
BA,bronchial asthma,TS-3824,the content of camp cgmp and camp phosphodiesterase activity were studied in lymphocytes of BA patients and normal persons before and min T3 euphylline administration in a dose of mgkg the campcgmp ratio was significantly lowered in patients euphylline administration led to its significant increase in normal persons this ratio remained unchanged some patients manifested an elevated activity of camp phosphodiesterase in these cases administration of euphylline brought about a significant increase in camp level in lymphocytes in the presence of the lowered activity of the enzyme phosphodiesterase in the remaining patients and in normal persons these indicators did not significantly change it is suggested that the mechanism of euphylline action is dependent on camp phosphodiesterase activity
EM,episodic memory,TS-3825,the hippocampus is necessary for declarative memory in humans and EM in rodents considerable current research is focused on the role of STDP within specific subfields of the hippocampus here using a viral vector to temporally control a focal deletion of the nr gene we show that learning novel paired associations between TPS cues and their context is dependent on ca nmda receptors deletion of ca nr genes in of the dorsal hippocampus was sufficient to disrupt new learning whereas the same treatment does not prevent expression of previously acquired paired associates and does not affect the ability to discriminate contexts or paired associate learning when either the cues or the context is familiar the findings suggest that ca nmda receptors specifically support the encoding of new experiences to involve incidental and contingent associations
FA,fluocinolone acetonide,TS-3826,DME dme remains one of the leading causes of moderate to severe vision loss although laser photocoagulation was the standard of care for several years few patients achieved significant improvements in VA as a result several pharmacotherapies and surgeries have been investigated the fluocinolone acetonide devices are one of the latest therapies considered for the treatment of dme despite bringing significant improvements in VA fluocinolone devices are associated with cataract formation increased intraocular pressure iop and surgery to lower iop due to the risk of complications FA devices should be considered only in cases refractive to firstline therapies in this review we evaluate current and emerging therapies for dme with special emphasis on FA intravitreal devices

SF,seizure free,TS-3832,many risk factors are encountered during the pathogenesis of epilepsy in this study the effect of seizure frequency on free radical generation and antioxidants levels in epileptic patients was evaluated this T0 was carried out on healthy controls gi and epileptic patients treated with mono or polytherapy of carbamazepine valproic acid or phenytoin the treated epileptic patients were divided into main groups according to the seizure frequency controlled seizure patients gii n and uncontrolled seizure patients giii n gii included the giia subgroup n which had been seizure free for more than months and the giib subgroup n which had been SF for a period from to months giii included giiia n and giiib n for patients which had a seizure frequency of less than and more than four timesmonth respectively in comparison to the control group gi the C2 of nitric oxide no and malondialdehydecreatinine ratio were significantly increased in giib giiia and giiib while vitamins a and e C2 were significantly decreased in giiib serum no C2 had significant negative correlations with serum VE in the giia and giib CG and with vitamin a in the giiia and giiib CG however serum no had positive rho with urinary mdacr ratio the imbalance between free radical generation and antioxidant system in epileptic patients may be a factor in seizure frequency
LA,large aggregates,TS-3833,antioxidant nanobiocomposites based on polyÎµcaprolactone pcl were prepared by incorporating hydroxytyrosol ht and a commercial montmorillonite cloisiteb cb at different concentrations a full structural thermal mechanical and functional characterization of the developed nanobiocomposites was carried out the presence of the nanoclay and ht increased pcl crystallinity whereas some decrease in thermal stability was observed tem analyses corroborated the good dispersion of cb into the pcl macromolecular structure as already asserted by xrd tests because no LA were observed a reduction in oxygen permeability and an increase in EM were obtained for films containing the nanoclay finally the presence of the nanoclay produced a decrease in the ht release from films due to some interaction between ht and B6 results proved that these nanobiocomposites can be an interesting and environmentally friendly alternative for AS food psi applications with antioxidant performance
TA,triamterene,TS-3834,T3 one oral dose of mg TA plasma levels of TA ta and its metabolites hydroxytriamterene ohta and hydroxytriamterene sulfuric acid ester ohtaester were studied in patients with normal and IRF and in patients submitted to hemodialysis TA and its metabolites were also determined in the urine and the dialysate respectively hydroxytriamterene sulfuric acid ester ohtaester representing a phaseiimetabolite of TA was found to yield PC which were always higher than those of native ta in decreased renal function the elimination halflives t of ta and ohtaester were increased yielding elevated plasma levels of ta and its metabolites the data of t for ta and ohtaester correlated with the creatinine clearance in an almost hyperbolic fashion dialysance values of about to mlmin were determined for ta and ohtaester
CV,closing volume,TS-3835,three CG of patients with obstruction of the small airways and normal main airways were submitted to T0 by determining the closing volume and the v maxv curve in the first group beginning chronic bronchitis was noted an alteration of the curve with normal CV in almost all the cases in the second group asthma in the remission phase the CV was increased and the curve normal in a part of the patients while in the other part the CV was normal and the curve altered in the third group recent heart infarct a significative increase in the CV was noted with a slightly altered curve improvement of the tests was obtained C2 of diuretics the improvement being far more noticeable for the CV than for the v maxv curve the CV is therefore an extremely CS test of the one of the small airways when the obstruction interests before all the basal zones of the lungs when the resistances of the small airways are irregularly distributed the determination of the v maxv curve is conversely more useful
FC,free carnitine,TS-3836,we evaluated the clinical significance of SS carnitine concentrations in determining the severity of impaired myocardial HFA metabolism in idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hcm we studied asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with hcm serum C2 of FC and acylcarnitine were measured by the enzymic cycling method SPECT with ilabelled piodophenylrsmethylpentadecanoic acid bmipp was performed and the images were analysed quantitatively and semiquantitatively SS free carnitine levels were significantly higher in hcm patients than in normal subjects and nmolml respectively p on the other hand SS acylcarnitine levels and acylfree carnitine ratios were lower in hcm patients than in normal subjects nmolml and compared with nmolml and respectively p clinical characteristics were not significantly different between the patients showing high and normal FC levels although female patients with high FC C2 were few p both quantitative and semiquantitative analyses revealed that the severity of decreased myocardial bmipp uptake was significantly correlated with SS free carnitine levels quantitative analysis r p semiquantitative analysis r p in the presence of reduced carnitine uptake into the myocardium in hcm there may also be reduced transport of acylcarnitines out of the myocardium into the plasma although inborn PE of HFA metabolism and carnitine deficiencies are reported to provoke AA hcm and are associated with low SS carnitine concentrations this study has revealed that the levels of carnitine are in contrast increased in idiopathic hcm moreover serum carnitine concentrations are a CS indicator of the severity of impaired myocardial HFA metabolism even in asymptomatic patients with hcm
TM,thrombomodulin,TS-3837,anticoagulants are pivotal agents for prevention and treatment of TE disorders limitations of existing anticoagulants vitamin k antagonist and heparins have led to the OD of newer anticoagulant therapies these anticoagulants have been designed to target TPS coagulation enzymes or steps in the coagulation pathway new anticoagulants that are under DUE in PCTs include inhibitors of the factor viiatissue factor pathway factor xa inhibitors both indirect and direct APC and soluble TM and direct thrombin inhibitors although most of these are parenteral agents several of the direct inhibitors of factor xa and thrombin are orally AS clinical OD of these therapies often starts with studies in the prevention of A-V thrombosis before evaluation for other indications such as prevention of cardioembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation or prosthetic heart valves at present the greatest clinical need is for an oral AC to replace warfarin for LT prevention and treatment of patients with A-V and arterial thrombosis ximelagatran an oral DTI is the first of a series of promising new agents that might fulfill this ct and transcis tc isomers studies have shown that cla specifically the tcisomer can reduce fat tissue deposition and body lipid content but appears to induce insulin resistance and fatty liver and spleen in various animals a few human studies suggest that cla supplementation has no effect on body weight and could reduce body fat to a much lesser extent than in animals to draw conclusions on this form of dietary supplementation and to ultimately make appropriate recommendations further human studies are required the postulated antiobesity mechanisms of cla include decreased energy and food intakes decreased lipogenesis and increased SE expenditure lipolysis and fat oxidation this review addresses recent studies of the effects of cla on lipid metabolism fat deposition and body composition in both animals and humans as well as the mechanisms surrounding these effects
DL,dim light,TS-3838,in computational terms we can solve the color constancy problem if device red green and blue sensor responses or rgbs for surfaces seen under an unknown illuminant can be mapped to corresponding rgbs under a known REF CS in recent years almost all authors have argued that this threedimensional problem is too hard it is argued that because a bright light striking a dark surface results in the same physical spectra as those of a DL incident on a CS surface the magnitude of rgbs cannot be recovered consequently modern color constancy algorithms attempt only to recover image chromaticities under the REF light they solve a twodimensional problem while significant progress has been made toward achieving chromaticity constancy recent work has shown that thedization to detect clone overlaps false positive and falsenegative hybridization errors the presence of chimeric clones and gaps in library coverage lead to ambiguity and error in the clone order genomes with good genetic maps such as neurospora crassa provide a means for reducing ambiguities and errors when constructing contig maps if clones can be anchored with genetic markers to the genetic map a software application called ods for creating contig maps based on cloneclone hybridization data is presented this application is also designed to exploit partial ordering information provided by anchorage of clones to a genetic map this information along with cloneclone hybridization data is used by a clone ordering algorithm and is represented graphically allowing users to interactively align PCS and genetic maps ods has a graphical user interface and is implemented entirely in java so it runs on multiple platforms other features include the flexibility of storing data in a local file or relational database and the ability to create full or minimum tiling contig maps
AR,autoregulation,TS-3839,the cushing response is a significant phenomenon associated with elevated icp the purpose of our study was to examine the effects of the intracranial hypertension level and duration on the cerebral tissue physiology using a MPA mpa the parameters monitored simultaneously included icp cbf mitochondrial nadh redox state extracellular k and h levels dc potential and ecog calculated cpp and blood pressure two groups of rats were used in one group icp was elevated to mmhg for min and in the second group icp was elevated to mmhg for min the results show that icp of mmhg led to cpp reduction below the lower limits of autoregulation however icp of mmhg even for a prolonged period of time is completely tolerated additionally we found that the cushing response developed in the moderate treatment icp mmhg is beneficial assuring high cbf C2 under intracranial hypertension furthermore cbf and cpp monitoring apparently are not sufficient for AR assessment more parameters are needed
VC,vitamin c,TS-3840,sorbic acid and potassium sorbate are widely used generally recognized as safe gras food additives with an extremely high mgkg acceptable daily NI level some children between the ages of months may actually ingest this amount while presently not permitted to be added directly to meat and poultry products in the us potassium sorbate has been proposed as a preservative for bacon as an additive in conjunction with nitrite and ascorbate or erythorbate sorbate and nitrite form several species of directacting mutagens and genotoxic agents when present together at phs mimicking gastric conditions two of the mutagens have been identified as ethylnitrolic acid and dinitromethylpyrrole mutagen formation is blocked by ascorbate at low ph ascorbate at eightfold molar excess leads to inactivation of dinitromethylpyrrole near neutral ph but does not destroy the mutagenic nitro compound at low phs the combination of sorbate with nitrite represents a potential health risk in the absence of adequate inactivating levels of ascorbate VC
CS,sensitive,TS-3841,bk polyomavirus bkpyv hereafter referred to as bk causes a lifelong chronic infection and is associated with debilitating disease in kidney Tx despite its importance aspects of the virus life cycle remain poorly understood in addition to the structural proteins the late region of the bk genome encodes for an auxiliary protein called agnoprotein studies on other polyomavirus agnoproteins have suggested that the protein may contribute to virion infectivity here we demonstrate an essential role for agnoprotein in bk virus release viruses lacking agnoprotein fail to PR from host cells and do not propagate to wildtype C2 despite this agnoprotein is not essential for virion infectivity or morphogenesis instead agnoprotein expression correlates with nuclear egress of bk virions we demonstrate that the agnoprotein IB partner Î±soluble nethylmaleimide CS F0 nsf attachment protein Î±snap is necessary for bk virion release and sirna knockdown of Î±snap prevents nuclear release of wildtype bk virions these data highlight a novel role for agnoprotein and begin to reveal the mechanism by which polyomaviruses leave an infected cell
CA,capsid,TS-3842,to T0 the kinetics and equilibrium of poliovirus IB to the PVR we used surface plasmon resonance to examine the interaction of a soluble form of the receptor with PV soluble receptor purified from mammalian cells is able to bind PV neutralize viral infectivity and induce structural changes in the virus particle binding studies revealed that there are two binding CS for the receptor on the poliovirus type CA with affinity constants at degrees c of kd microm and kd microm the relative abundance of the two binding sites varies with temperature at degrees c the kd site constitutes approximately of the total IB CS on the sensor chip and its relative abundance decreased with decreasing temperature such that at degrees c the relative abundance of the kd site is only of the total IB sites absolute levels of the kd site remained relatively constant at all temperatures tested the two IB CS may correspond to docking CS for domain of the receptor on the viral CA as predicted by a model of the poliovirusreceptor complex alternatively the binding sites may be a consequence of structural breathing or could result from receptorinduced conformational changes in the virus

EB,energy balance,TS-3844,the intent of this paper is to address the obesity epidemic which is a term used to describe the sudden and rapid increase in obesity rates that began in the s and continues unabated today since the entire population regardless of starting weight is gradually gaining weight this has led to escalating obesity rates and to obesity being considered one of the most serious public health challenges facing the world at one level the obesity epidemic is a classic geneenvironment interaction where the human genotype is susceptible to environmental influences that affect energy NI and SE expenditure it is also a problem of energy balance understanding the etiology of obesity requires the T0 of how behavioral and environmental AF have interacted to produce positive EB and WG reversing the epidemic of obesity will require modifying some combination of these AF to help the population achieve EB at a healthy body weight while body weight is strongly influenced by biological and behavioral AF changes in the environment promoting positive SE balance have been most responsible for the obesity epidemic our best strategy for reversing the obesity epidemic is to focus on preventing positive EB in the population through small changes in diet and physical activity that take advantage of our biological systems for regulating EB simultaneously we must address the environment to make it easier to make better food and physical activity choices this is a very longterm strategy for first stopping and then reversing the escalating obesity rates but one that can over time return obesity rates to pres levels
CC,clomiphene,TS-3845,the acute effects of low doses of clomiphene citrate upon serum lh within the first two hours after the i.v. into ovariectomized estrogenprogesterone blocked rats were investigated there was a shortlasting elevation of lh release min after injection of microng clomiphene a second lh releasing effect occurred within min when microng CC or more were injected doses between these two dose C2 were not ERP it is concluded that these effects may probably be due to a partial reduction of distinct estrogen receptor CS both in the hypothalamus and in the pituitary which causes a shortlasting decrease of the negative feedback of the circulating estrogens
MA,methylamine,TS-3846,the first interaction between target cell and hormone gives rise to hormonal imprinting which accounts for greater responsiveness of the cell at later interactions the mechanism of hormonal imprinting is obscure we based exp approach to its closer T0 on combined treatment of tetrahymena as MM cells with DIT t which stimulates the division and cell growth inhibitors which interfere with different stages of cell reproduction and MA which inhibits cluster formation in the membrane of these actinomycin d and MA inhibited the growth of the tetrahymena while colchicine did not and all three suppressed the division stimulating action of t but could not prevent hormonal imprinting as demonstrated on later reexposure to t of cells preexposed and not preexposed to t in combination with the inhibitors it appears that the underlying mechanism of hormonal imprinting is highly complex and involves many subcellular mechanisms and structures but suppression of or gross interference with one or another of these cannot delete only quantitatively reduce the consequence of the first interaction with the hormone ie hormonal imprinting
MF,mitotic figures,TS-3847,examination of livers from transgenic mice over expressing hGH hgh revealed numerous alterations including a striking incidence of MF the reason for increased proliferation is unclear but could be related to effects of hgh which is also acting as a lactogen in rodents in order to identify some of the actions of gh we have examined the effects of rat and human gh and rat prolactin on proliferation as well as on morphological differentiation of normal rat CL cells in vitro these cells isolated from a dayold rat proliferate in SC incorporate brdu and are thus strikingly different from primary cultures of isolated HCs which typically are nonproliferating cells monolayers of these cells were treated with rat prolactin rprl rat growth hormone rgh rprl and rgh in combination or hgh for hr subsequently mitotic figures were counted and the cultures were processed for transmission electron microscopy the incidence of MF was significantly increased by rprl versus control while rgh and hgh significantly decreased proliferation in controls of the proliferating cells were in prophase approximately in metaphase and approximately in telophase in contrast rprl caused a significant increase in the number of cells in prophase and reduced the number of cells in the other mitotic stages hgh and rgh reduced the overall number of MF unexpectedly the effects of rgh plus rprl were different from the effect of hgh in addition each treatment caused distinct morphological changes of liver cell organellesabstract truncated at words
DMF,dimethyl fumarate,TS-3848,following the introduction of interferon beta b as the first immunomodulatory therapy for multiple sclerosis ms in there are currently nine substances or substance classes approved for the treatment of ms ie alemtuzumab azathioprine DMF fingolimod glatiramer acetate interferon beta mitoxantrone natalizumab and teriflunomide major developments during the last years include the approval of orally administered medications ie fingolimod teriflunomide and DMF a monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab as well as GA with an administration frequency three times a week and a pegylated formulation of interferon beta a the broadened therapeutic options enable a more differentiated and individualized therapy of ms however evidencebased data for therapeutic decisionmaking relevant in clinical practice are not always available rare but potentially severe and even lifethreatening SE of immunotherapies for ms require continuous pharmacovigilance and adherence to RM plans

MA,methylamine,TS-3866,several cases of zinc zn deficiency in human infants caused by abnormally low concentrations of zn in breast milk were recently reported the underlying mechanism of which is not known alphamacroglobulin alpham a major znbinding ligand in serum presents a potential vehicle for mammary zn uptake this study was conducted to determine if an alpham receptor is present in human mammary epithelial cells where it may be involved in the endocytosis of alpham into the MG normal human mammary epithelial cells were grown to confluency in SF medium for all IB and uptake studies alpham preactivated with MA and labeled with i was added to cells for varied lengths of time to determine saturation over time and at varied concentrations to determine saturation over increasing concentration of ligand nonspecific and competitive IB were measured by addition of a fold molar excess of unlabeled alpham and SS Al or lactoferrin respectively binding at degreesc was specific for alpham and approached saturation kinetics at nmoll scatchard plot analysis of the IB data demonstrated more than one IB site a high affinity saturable binding site and a LA nonsaturable IB site uptake of alpham at degreesc was rapid and continuous over increasing concentrations of alpham and internalized alpham was rapidly degraded results from this study present evidence for receptormediated uptake of alpham in human MECs which in turn provides a potential mechanism for zn acquisition by the cell
TS,tensile strength,TS-3867,the relationship between dividing properties of the scored tablet and dynamic characteristics of the powder was investigated for proving the effects of physical characteristics of the powder on dividing properties of the scored tablet lactose MCC CS synthetic aluminum silicate and perfiller were used as excipients the dynamic characteristics of the powder such as TS t cohesive force c angle of friction delta flow factor ff shear index n ctk and constants of kawakitas equation of tapping compaction a b were measured no correlations between coefficient of R2 of divided tablet weight and each dynamic characteristics of the powder were found however from the result of the MRA multiple regression equation containing c and a as variables was obtained then a significant rho was obtained between coefficient of R2 of divided tablet weight and ca and also between logarithms of dividing strength of scored tablets and ca as a result coefficient of R2 of divided tablet weight decreased and dividing strength of scored tablets increased with decreasing ca value
LDA,limiting dilution analysis,TS-3868,LDA has been applied to the T0 of tcell helper function in vitro using the microculture system one can estimate the numbers of a Th cells involved in specific collaboration with b cells and b those t cells which are able on being G1 by their TPS antigen to facilitate the response of B1 to another antigen such studies have enabled us to demonstrate that a single helper t cell was able to activate a single bcell precursor to detectable antibody production the helper function of primed TA was radioresistant a minimal estimate of helper frequencies could be obtained in defined cell populations nonspecific facilitation was directed towards virtually all available b cells of a given specificity if these were challenged with their appropriate particulate antigen the microculture system offers the opportunity to determine whether specific and nonspecific tcell helper effects are a consequence of the activity of one tcell type or of differenct subpopulations of TA
MAC,anesthetic requirement,TS-3869,alpha AR agonists such as clonidine are sedatives and enhance the effectiveness of several different kinds of anesthetics this study was performed to quantitate the effect of dexmedetomidine a novel alpha adrenoceptor agonist on the action of the volatile anesthetic agent ISO in rats in vivo a separate set of experiments in rat HPC slices was designed to determine whether isoflurane and dexmedetomidine exerted similar effects on synaptic transmission in vitro and to examine the interaction between the two agents in vivo dexmedetomidine microgramskg ip reduced isoflurane minimum AM MAC mac determined by loss of response to tail pinch by approximately in hippocampal ca neurons on the other hand there was a relatively small potentiation of the effects of isoflurane at the maximally effective dexmedetomidine concentration nm the hippocampal ca area at least in the slice preparation may thus not be representative of the cns CS at which alpha AR agonists lessen MAC in vivo
SCM,serumcontaining medium,TS-3870,one of the important criteria for achieving efficient nanoparticlebased targeted drug delivery is that the drug is not prematurely released at offtarget sites here we report the preclinical evaluation of a serumstable dendrimerbased drug conjugate capable of actively targeting into prostate CA pc cells delivered through the prostatespecific membrane antigen psma multiple molecules of psmabinding small molecule glutamate urea gla targeting agent and the drug methotrexate mtx were conjugated to generation pamam dendrimer g through cufree click chemistry the gla was conjugated through a SD NH bond and the mtx was conjugated either through ester es or NH amcoupling to generate gglamesmtxn and gglamammtxn respectively in SCM free mtx was slowly released from gglamesmtxn with mtx released from the dendrimer in h whereas the mtx on gglamammtxn was CR stable the gglamammtxn bound and internalized into psmaexpressing lncap cells but not into psmanegative pc cells the conjugateinhibited recombinant dihydrofolate reductase and induced potent cytotoxicity in the lncap celerved pathological conditions not much information about borderline abnormalities is available in this study a crosssectional T0 to analyze the relationships between erythropoiesis and nutrition physical features and laboratory test findings was conducted in MA and older men and women the study included japanese people men and women age years and over analysis of variance showed that the group with a tendency to anemia was older had a lower body mass index and diastolic blood pressure and had higher SS adiponectin and creatinine multiple regression analysis showed that adiponectin triglycerides and total protein were common AF that affected IDE in both men and women hepatic renal and cardiac functions were also AF involved in IDE in men and in PM women in addition nutrient factors such as alcohol vitamins and carbohydrates were also significantly involved in erythropoiesis in men but there were no significant nutrient factors involved in erythropoiesis in either premenopausal or PM women this T0 showed that factors that influence erythropoiesis differ between men premenopausal women and postmenopausal women and it suggested that appropriately modifying IDE management for each group of people is essential

SA,spherical aberration,TS-3944,for a triaxial ellipsoid in an optical trap with SA the optical forces torque and stress are analyzed using vectorial ray tracing the torque will automatically regulate ellipsoids long axis parallel to optic axis for a trapped ellipsoid with principal axes in the ratio the high AS distribution appears in xz plane and the optical force at xaxis is weaker than at yaxis due to the shape size while the ellipsoid departs laterally from trap center the measurable maximum transverse forces will be weakened due to axial equilibrium and affected by inclined orientation for an appropriate ring beam the maximum optical forces are strong in 3D thus this optical trap is appropriate to trap cells for avoiding damage from laser
ET,essential thrombocythemia,TS-3945,the jakvf mutation was found in most patients with myeloproliferative disorders mpds including polycythemia vera ET and primary myelofibrosis we have generated transgenic mice expressing the mutated enzyme in the hematopoietic system driven by a vav gene promoter the mice are viable and fertile one line of the transgenic mice which expressed a lower level of jakvf showed moderate elevations of blood cell counts whereas another L1 with a higher level of jakvf expression displayed marked increases in blood counts and developed phenotypes that closely resembled human essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera the latter line of mice also developed primary myelofibrosislike symptoms as they aged the transgenic mice showed erythroid MK and granulocytic hyperplasia in the bone marrow and SP displayed splenomegaly and had reduced levels of plasma erythropoietin and thrombopoietin they possessed an increased number of hematopoietic progenitor cells in IP blood spleen and bone marrow and these cells formed autonomous colonies in the absence of growth factors and cytokines the data show that jakvf can cause mpds in mice our study thus provides a mouse model to study the pathologic role of jakvf and to develop treatment for mpds
RL,latency,TS-3946,in the present experiment the participation of the internal part of the GP gp in the initiation and the execution of a pointing movement was investigated in four baboons papio papio the effects of gp exclusion on the response RL the movement execution time and the pointing accuracy were analyzed two different methods were used to exclude the gp in two cases cryogenic blockade was induced using a chronic cryoprobe implanted contralaterally to the operant hand two other animals underwent a partial electrolytic destruction of the gp CL to the AS hand the effects of gp exclusion on reaction times movement times and pointing accuracy were compared for movements with variable amplitudes and directions for all animals the gp exclusion resulted in a decrease in reaction time but an increase in movement time and spatial error none of these modifications was increased by variations in the biomechanic characteristics of the movement these data show that the gp in baboons is concerned with a the initiation of a pointing movement without playing a critical role in the encoding of amplitude and direction parameters and b the execution of this movement the possible involvement of the gp in sensorymotor integration postural adjustments and muscular synergy is discussed

CP,polymer,TS-3948,an overlooked factor in biomaterial research is the surface molecular flexibility for CP based implants the mobility of the CP chains provides a way for the surface to adapt itself to the environment this is relevant when the implant comes in contact with a biological fluid and its constituents by changing the length of the alkyl side chain of polyalkyl methacrylates pamas an interesting opportunity is provided where it is possible to T0 the surface molecular mobility without changing the surface hydrophobicity nor does it introduce any additives or any changes in the degree of polymer crosslinking four variants of pamas were implanted in the peritoneum of balbc mice using a well described setup end points were taken T3 h and estimations of inflammatory cell recruitment and implantassociated cells were studied relationship between surface molecular mobility and inflammatory cell recruitment as well as surfaceassociated cells was noted
PN,peripheral lymph nodes,TS-3949,the mel receptor mel r expressed by murine lymphocytes represents the peripheral CL nodespecific homing receptor and is essential for mu lymphocytes to specifically adhere to high endothelial venules hev of the PN and to ultimately migrate in vivo into the parenchyma of this lymphoid organ a peyers patchspecific homing receptor termed lpam is now appreciated to mediate mu lymphocyte adhesion to peyers patch hev we previously demonstrated that the cell surface density of the mel r was markedly reduced following pmainduced protein kinase c activation of lymphocytes in the present T0 we investigated the phenotypic and functional expression of lpam by mu lymphocytes exposed to pma the results show that the surface expression of lpam on G1 lymphocytes remains constant under conditions where mel r is downregulated significantly additionally the surface expression of lpam is not influenced by calcium ionophore either CT or in combination with pma whereas the pmainduced loss of mel r is synergized by calcium ionophore therefore lpam and mel r expression are differentially regulated by G1 mu lymphocytes lpam expressed by tk peyers patch hevbinding murine lymphoma and mel r expressed by c peripheral lymph node hevbinding mu lymphoma were found to be regulated by the consequences of pma activation in a DP similar to that of normal lymphocytes furthermore we provide evidence that mel r internalization is not involved in the loss of the receptor expressed by G1 lymphocytesabstract truncated at words
PD,protein deposition,TS-3950,a single cohort of small individuals mm mean shell length mg mean dry flesh weight of the marine bivalve mollusc mytilus galloprovincialis lmk was held sequentially for wk at each of four food levels equivalent to ingested rations of less than and of dry body weight per day growth rate reached a maximum at the highest ration level and was strongly correlated amongst individuals with mean heterozygosity measured across nine enzyme loci rates of SE expenditure were analysed separately as maintenance metabolic rate and the SE costs of growth j mg dry tissue the maintenance metabolic rate correlated with traits of protein metabolism protein synthesis deposition and breakdown and the separate SE costs of both maintenance and growth correlated with the efficiency of protein deposition protein growth as a proportion of synthesis the energy costs of growth also varied in negative relation to mean individual heterozygosity in a MRA the SE allocation to the costs of growth body size mean heterozygosity and the efficiency of PD together explained of the variance amongst individuals in observed rates of growth the results support the hypothesis that individual variability in the SE costs of protein turnover and in the efficiency of PD during rapid growth are significant factors providing a link between individual genotype and its phenotypic expression as growth

PT,percutaneous tracheostomy,TS-3952,tracheal stenosis is a potential complication of tracheostomy the present study aimed to describe the epidemiologic profile of SGS in a referral AMC during a year period all patients who had been admitted in an intensive care unit of imam khomeini hospital affiliated to tehran university of medical sciences and had undergone percutaneous tracheostomy during days after ET intubation were enrolled in the study after removing the tracheostomy tube patients were evaluated regarding OD of tracheal stenosis using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and MSCT scan during the T0 period PT was performed in patients with a mean age of years overall patients died due to the severity of the disorder during hospitalization in the remaining patients cases needed permanent or LT mechanical ventilation and were excluded from the study twelve patients died during the first months and patients were left for final assessment multislice computed tomography scan imaging showed subglottic stenosis in cases of these patients had tracheal stenosis of tracheal stenosis of was found in cases patients in whom the tracheostomy tube had been removed in the first weeks after tracheostomy did not present tracheal stenosis n the present study revealed that subglottic stenosis is frequent in patients who have undergone PT in the intensive ECU setting however the stenosis is generally mild and is not associated with serious and or lifethreatening clinical manifestations
SFM,serumfree medium,TS-3953,we recently demonstrated that dendritic cells dcs can be generated from monocytes in the presence of high concentrations of human SS hs provided the extracellular ph is maintained at plasma values because monocytederived dcs modcs can also be generated in the presence of fetal CS fcs or serumfree medium we have investigated whether these different culture supplements influence dc generation with this aim purified monocytes were cultured with gmcsf plus il for days and were further exposed to tnfalpha for additional days in the presence of hs AP ap fcs or xvivo a SFM our results show that good yields of functionally mature dcs can reproducibly be obtained in the presence of hs or ap as assessed by cd and cd upregulation dextranfitc uptake allogeneic mlr assays and the induction of an autologous response interestingly the effect of serum on dc generation was probably not only quantitative but also qualitative since i the majority of hs or apcultured dcs expressed cd with very weak C2 of cda whereas cd dcs cultured in fcs or xvivo were mostly cda ii HS and apcultured dcs were much more granular and heterogeneous than fcs or xvivocultured dcs and iii the presence of birbecklike LG was preferentially observed in HS or apcultured dcs as assessed by electron microscopy that these different cells resemble dermal dcs ddcs was further supported by the observations that most of the cells displayed intracytoplasmic fxiiia in the absence of lag antigen and expressed ecadherin at very low levels altogether our results indicate that starting from the same monocytic population different subsets of dcs can be generated depending on the culture conditions thus hs or ap favors the generation of fully mature dcs that resemble G1 dermal dcs whereas fcs or xvivo preferentially leads to the generation of less mature cda dermallike dcs
MET,dlmethionine,TS-3954,oxidation of dlhydroxy methylthiobutanoic acid dlhmb MET dlmet and lmethionine lmet in chicken tissue homogenates was compared using clabelled tracers the DP of oxidation of the substrates was similar at both low mm and high mm concentrations the rate of conversion to keto methylthiobutanoic acid kmb was highest for dlmet and lowest for lmet in kidney liver and intestinal mucosa in breast muscle rates for dlmet and lmet were similar at mm but dlhmb showed the highest rate at mm kidney contained the highest TPS activity for oxidation of all three substrates raising the ph of CL and kidney homogenates from to increased the oxidation of dlmet exclusively experiments with inhibitors of dhydroxy acid dehydrogenase ec and lhydroxy acid oxidase ec suggested that d and lhmb were stereospecifically oxidized by the enzymes kmb stimulated lmet oxidation in kidney yet inhibited lmet oxidation in CL homogenates the effect of kmb on dlmet and dlhmb oxidation also varied between tissues AOA inhibited lmet oxidation CR and dlmet and dlhmb oxidation almost completely in both kidney and liver lcycloserine was less potent than AOA and decreased lmet oxidation more in kidney than in CL it can be calculated from the results that at low ATP concentrations the liver contributes principally to the whole body oxidation of both dlhmb and dlmet at high greater than physiological concentrations dlhmb would be oxidized principally in skeletal muscle at all concentrations lmet would be converted to kmb mainly in the muscle
FR,fertilization rate,TS-3955,protein degradation is essential for oogenesis and embryogenesis the ubiquitinproteasome system regulates many cellular processes via the rapid Kd of specific proteins ubiquitin carboxylterminal hydrolase l uchl is exclusively expressed in neurons testis ovary and placenta each of which has unique biological MICs however the PET role of uchl in mouse oocytes remains unknown here we report the expression pattern of uchl and its isozyme uchl in mouse ovaries and embryos using immunocytochemistry uchl was selectively detected on the plasma membrane whereas uchl was mainly detected in the cytoplasm suggesting that these isozymes have distinct functions in mouse eggs to further investigate the functional role of uchl in mouse eggs we analyzed the FR of uchldeficient ova of gad female mice female gad mice had a significantly increased rate of polyspermy in in IVF assays although the rate of fertilization did not differ significantly from WT in addition the litter size of gad female mice was significantly reduced compared with wildtype mice these results may identify uchl as a candidate for a spermoocyte interactive binding or FP on the plasma membrane that functions during the block to polyspermy in mouse oocytes
BI,barthel index,TS-3956,a comprehensive DUE of polypathological patients pp should always include a PET DUE for this purpose a modified version of the BI bi is the most applied questionnaire and it consists of a variable scale the aim of this study was to develop a screening and confirmation tool to diagnose high disability with the fewest number of dimensions of the bi as possible
ASA,anterior spinal artery,TS-3957,a case of ASA occlusion associated with acute Sm infection is reported and it is suggested that there is a direct relationship it is postulated that there is initially an arteritis which leads to obstruction of either the ASA itself its branches or one or more of the tributary anterior radicular arteries
AI,aortic insufficiency,TS-3958,the transcutaneous doppler flow detector is not presently suited for volume quantitation however the arterial flow velocity profile has been established as a valuable procedure for the diagnosis of IP arterial disease and assessment of abnormalities of peripheral flow that may result from cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac dysfunction distinctive diagnostic arterial flow patterns in patients with HCM subaortic stenosis and in patients with AI have been described occlusive venous disease in the popliteal vein and more PT vessels can be diagnopsed with an accuracy that justifies the use of the doppler US as a screening procedure in individuals subject to thrombophlebitis it is reasonable to anticipate that future work with pulsed doppler instruments will establish this technique of imaging as a practical clinical method for noninvasive arteriography
TF,tubular fluid,TS-3959,the purpose of this study was to assess the concentrations of lh that leydig cells are exposed to upon in vivo stimulation of steroidogenesis the concentrations of lh were measured in rats in testicular interstitial ECF seminiferous TF and BP from testicular veins from one testis before and from the other testis of the same rats T3 an intravenous i.t. of gonadotrophinreleasing hormone gnrh or saline and compared with the concentrations in BP from a peripheral vein the concentrations of lh in ISF surrounding the leydig cells before the injections were about of the C2 in BP and showed no significant rise at min and a much smaller rise at later times in rats injected with gnrh than those seen in blood plasma from either of the two sources which were similar the concentrations of lh in tubular fluid were even lower and showed no NC T3 gnrh testosterone concentrations in testicular cells interstitial fluid and testicular A-V blood plasma were significantly increased by min after gnrh when compared with salineinjected controls with no NC in the C2 in TF the rise in testosterone concentrations in testicular A-V plasma after gnrh was smaller than those in the cells and ISF in conclusion the concentrations of lh reaching the testicular interstitial fluid were only about onetenth of that measured in the circulation presumably because the endothelial cells restrict access of the hormone to the interstitial fluid this indicated that either the leydig cells are extremely CS to lh stimulation or that testicular endothelial cells modulate the action of lh on the leydig cells
SF,seizure free,TS-3960,pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma pxa is a rare primary BB RT which usually involves the superficial cortex in children and young adults although pxa is considered an astrocytic tumor recent studies suggest the presence of neuronal differentiation and an origin from multipotential precursor cells to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics which have not been well established due to the rarity of this RT eight cases of histologically proven pxa were retrospectively analyzed paying special attention to immunohistochemical findings and associated CD three males and five females of median age years range years were enrolled in the study all patients presented with epilepsy RT CS included the temporal n FC n and temporoparietal n lobes ffdg pet positron emission tomography showed hypometabolism of pxa immunohistochemical T0 was performed in six cases using various antibodies for glial and neuronal markers gross total resection of the pxa was achieved in all cases the followup period ranged from to years except for two recent cases all patients are doing well with neither radiological nor clinical evidence of recurrence the surgical treatment rendered all patients SF the three temporal lobe pxas were associated with CD in one tumor clusters of dysmorphic GCs were found all examined pxas demonstrated immunoreactivity for both neuronal and glial markers in the various tumor cells the immunohistochemical studies undertaken as a part of this T0 support the proposed astrocytic and neuronal differentiation of pxa and indicate that pxa is probably a developmental neuroglial RT with prominent glioproliferative changes associated with FCD CD may be a cause of persistent epilepsy even after CR surgical excision of pxa
PDT,photodynamic treatment,TS-3961,the case report describes the surgical and PDT pdt of an equine sarcoid in a yearold gelding a mass on the VP prepuce several tumours on the lateral aspect of the prepuce and one sarcoid on the front aspect of the chest were treated for pdt temoporfin fospegÂ® biolitec ag jena at a concentration of mgml was injected locally the subsequent irradiation was performed using a redlight laser nm with an energy density of jcmÂ² the mass on the VP aspect of the prepuce and some of the lateral tumours displayed total remission the remaining tumours decreased in size or stopped growing
DS,direction selectivity,TS-3962,retinal BCs bcs transmit visual signals in parallel channels from the outer to the inner retina where they provide glutamatergic inputs to specific networks of amacrine and GCs intricate network computation at bc axon terminals has been proposed as a mechanism for complex network computation such as DS but direct knowledge of the receptive field property and the synaptic connectivity of the axon terminals of various bc types is required in order to understand the role of axonal computation by bcs the present T0 tested the essential assumptions of the presynaptic MM of DS at axon terminals of three functionally distinct bc types that ramify in the directionselective strata of the mouse retina results from twophoton ca imaging optogenetic stimulation and dual patchclamp recording demonstrated that cb cells do not receive fast gabaergic synaptic FB from starburst amacrine cells sacs lightevoked and spontaneous ca responses are well coordinated among various local regions of cb axon terminals B6 axon terminals are not directionally selective cb cells consist of two novel PET subtypes with distinct receptive field structures cb cells provide direct excitatory synaptic inputs to but receive no direct gabaergic synaptic feedback from sacs and cb axon terminals are not directionally selective either these findings help to simplify models of direction selectivity by ruling out complex computation at bc terminals they also show that B6 comprises two PET subclasses of bcs

DBA,dolichos biflorus,TS-3965,offspring of mothers with diabetes mellitus were examined prospectively with the use of a detailed checklist diabetic women were usually identified in the late first or early second trimester and thereafter rigorously managed in hopes of achieving euglycemia the frequency of infants with major anomalies was higher in WG classes b to f than in either the general population or in a small group of concurrently gathered control subjects the frequency of anomalies in class a diabetes was a rate that may or may not be increased of the L1 anomalies observed in diabetic F1 six involved the heart and three involved the skeletal system no pattern of minor anomalies appeared to exist limited data failed to reveal a TPS hla type that conferred increased risk for anomalies and chromosomal CA were not increased in frequency if hyperglycemia is indeed the alin a conasepharose b reduction with mercaptoethanol electrophoresis on polyacrylamide slab gels and periodic acidschiff pas staining resolved the major glycoproteins into at least components of mr k k k k and k neuraminidase removed essentially all the sialic acid whether or not the glycoproteins were solubilized with detergents neuraminidase treatment increased the electrophoretic mobility of most components on onedimension PAGE indicating their sialoglycoprotein nature an antiserum was raised in rabbits against isolated epidermal BPM glycoproteins isolated immunoglobulins were used in crossed immunoelectrophoretic analysis of the glycoproteins and produced L1 immunoprecipitates the glycoprotein nature of the immunoprecipitates was shown by their susceptibility to neuraminidase crossed immunoelectrophoresis was used to examine the lectin IB specificity of isolated epidermal BPM glycoproteins the immunoprecipitation patterns were affected strongly by ricinus communis agglutinin rca moderately by wheatgerm agglutinin wga and weakly by soybean agglutinin sba peanut agglutinin pna DBA agglutinin dba and ulex europaeus agglutinin uea had little effect on the IP patterns indicating little interaction between epidermal plasma membrane glycoprotein and these lectins other glycoproteins andor glycolipids must therefore be responsible for the binding of these lectins by epidermal cells
BL,blood loss,TS-3966,it is generally believed that postpartum BL is less in patients whose labour is induced with prostaglandins than in patients delivered without induction however PP blood loss is known to be greater with precipitate labour and labours induced with oxytocin and prostaglandins unless an oxytocic agent is continued after delivery a retrospective T0 was undertaken at the UH of the west indies to look at the outcome of induced labour during months octoberdecember misoprostol induction was compared to the outcome after oxytocin induction misoprostol induction plus oxytocin augmentation and those patients who delivered without oxytocics during this same time period during that period patients were delivered and were induced with misoprostol with oxytocin misoprostol plus oxytocin and without oxytocic seven patients were eliminated from further analysis as we were unsure of their induction status results showed no significant differences between the CG for variables such as maternal age parity and fetal birth weight there was a significantly greater mean BL at delivery with all induced labour compared with those not induced for misoprostol sd ml oxytocin sd ml and for oxytocin plus misoprostol sd ml while controls had the lowest mean BL sd ml occurring where no predelivery oxytocic was needed p PP haemorrhage was highest with misoprostol versus for no oxytocic for oxytocin and for misoprostol plus oxytocin however none of these values reached statistical significance the misoprostol group also had the shortest first stage T2 versus T2 for oxytocin minutes when both misoprostol and oxytocin was used and minutes with no oxytocic BL was also independently directly associated with placental weight p and fetal birth weight p as well as the length of the L3 of labour p but not the length of the first stage of labour induction of labour with oxytocic agents is associated with greater blood loss however increased BL is not due to precipitate labour CT
NP,normal pregnant women,TS-3967,macrophage colonystimulating factor mcsf is a characteristic cytokine that plays an essential role in placenta maintenance and TAT iii complex tat is a hemostatic marker that is remarkably altered both in normal pregnancy and in preeclampsia the present T0 was designed in order to show various levels of mcsf and tat in pregnancies IP blood was collected from subjects of whom were NP women consisting of the four CG namely th th th and th weeks of gestation were PE Pr women th week of gestation mean blood pressure mm hg and were nonpregnant controls we compared blood mcsf and tat levels among them results showed that blood mcsf and tat levels increased significantly with gestational age furthermore the ratio of increase in mcsf was significantly lower than that in tat in NP compared with controls in contrast the ratio of increase in mcsf was significantly higher than that in tat in PE women compared with NP these results concerning the ratio of increase in mcsf and tat have not been reported these findings show that mcsf level increases significantly in preeclampsia even in its earlier stage exhibiting a systolic blood pressure of less than mm hg
FP,footpad,TS-3968,the antitumor cellular immune response to gross virusinduced rat RT cells in f rats as measured by a sensitive radioisotopic FP assay was adoptively transferred to syngeneic rats and to xenogeneic irradiated balbc mice xenogeneic transfer was accomplished by the i.t. of a mixture of rat RT cells and syngeneic SP cells PECs or BL from TPS immune rats into the footpads of mice PE cells produced the strongest FP reaction in xenogeneic recipients use of the xenogeneic adoptive transfer system in a bioassay for human antitumor immunity appeared feasible
NP,nasopharyngeal,TS-3969,VA has been shown to induce nasal lesions in rodents in inhalation bioassays a physiologically based pharmacokinetic pbpk model for vinyl acetate has been used in human risk assessment but previous in vivo validation was conducted only in rats controlled human exposures to VA were conducted to provide validation data for the application of the model in humans five volunteers were exposed to and ppm cc VA via inhalation a probe inserted into the NP region sampled both cc vinyl acetate and the major metabolite cc acetaldehyde during rest and CS exercise nasopharyngeal air concentrations were analyzed in real time by ion trap mass spectrometry msms experimental concentrations of both VA and acetaldehyde were then compared to predicted concentrations calculated from the previously published human model model predictions of VA nasal SE compared favorably with measured values of VA as did predictions of nasopharyngeal acetaldehyde when compared to measured acetaldehyde the results showed that the current pbpk model structure and parameterization are AGA for VA these analyses were conducted from to ppm VA a range relevant to workplace SE standards but which would not be expected to saturate VA metabolism risk assessment based on this model further concluded that h per day exposures up to ppm do not present concern regarding cancer or noncancer toxicity validation of the vinyl acetate human pbpk MM provides support for these conclusions
CB,cognitivebehavioral,TS-3970,nonsuicidal selfinjury nssi has many behavioral and cognitive features that would make it appear to be closely tied to obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd obsessivecompulsiverelated disorders ocrds have been described in the literature as conditions that share a common phenomenology neurobiology and treatment response the authors reviewed the literature describing the degree that nssi is similar to and distinct from ocrds based on these hypothesized common Az they conclude with recommendations for conceptualization that draws partly from the ocrd literature and from CB models of rumination
CT,counseling and testing,TS-3971,a common assumption is that outreachbased hiv counseling and testing services reach a clientele with a higher hiv seroprevalence than clinicbased CT to examine this assumption we analyzed wisconsins anonymous counseling and testing client records for contacts testing episodes from to bivariate analysis of CT service setting outreachbased or clinicbased and hiv test results suggested that outreach contacts were odds ratio or confidence interval ci more likely to test hivseropositive than clinicbased contacts relations between hiv test outcome and variables for client age race gender previous testing history mode of risk SE and region as well as service setting were examined by LR an inverted relation between service setting and seropositivity or ci indicated that within some subpopulations outreach contacts were significantly less likely to test hivpositive than clinicbased contacts analysis of interactions among the covariates identified race as a critical codeterminant in the relation between service setting and test outcome these results support retargeting outreach services to enhance their overall effectiveness TPS recommendations include the need for aggressive strategies to better market hiv CT to nonwhite populations and to focus resources more selectively on gaybisexual men of all races
BR,breathing rate,TS-3972,hyperoxia has previously been found to increase VO2 oxygen consumption vo and co production vco in P0 mammals we asked whether the same occurs in the P0 infant PLB pattern was measured in fullterm infants to days of age from the spirometric record obtained with a pneumotachograph attached to a FM concentrations of o and co were continuously measured at the mouth vo and vco were computed as the product of ve and the difference between inspired and expired concentration of the respective gases min of air fio and min of o fio a bias flow through the mask and pneumotachograph delivered the inspired gas and eliminated the effects of the instrumental dead space in neither case did measurements at min significantly differ from those taken at min in hyperoxia ve increased in of the infants in average p less than paired twotailed t test because of a rise in tidal volume p less than and a decrease in BR p less than VA va increased by about p less than vo and vco increased by and respectively p less than the rise in vo was too large to be explained by the greater respiratory work of the hyperventilation whereas that of vco was not large enough to fully explain the increase in va we conclude that in newborn humans as in other P0 species the normoxic VO2 seems to be limited by the availability of oabstract truncated at words
VM,valsalva maneuver,TS-3973,the main component method was used to analyze measurements of cardiovascular parameters taken in healthy operators at rest the entire sample included observations each observation was characterized by the deviation of heart rate mean blood pressure and stroke volume from individual data points the latter were individual mean values of the above parameters recorded during the VM the first two main components were responsible for over of total variance of signs visual analysis of observation distribution with respect to the components revealed small group and single data points situated peripherally at a distance from the L1 constellation of data points with respect to the values in these CG it can be assumed that some of them correspond to the stressed state of the CVS two thirds of data points in the stressed groups are associated with the subjects who show a weak reaction to the valsalva maneuver and one third corresponds to the true stressed state taking into account the VM the deviations from individual data points can be used to identify the stressed state of the cardiovascular system in healthy men at rest
CBP,calmodulinbinding peptide,TS-3974,overexpression of the plasma membrane calcium pump pmca isoform b by means of the baculovirus system enabled us for the first time to T0 the kinetics of calmodulin binding to this pump this was done by stoppedflow fluorescence measurements using chloroaminolysnndiethylaminophenyltriazinylcalmodulin tacalmodulin upon mixing with pmca the fluorescence of tacalmodulin changed along a biphasic curve a rapid and small increase in fluorescence was followed by a slow and C1 decrease that lasted about s the experiment was done at several pmca concentrations global fitting nonlinear regression analysis of these results led to a MM in which pmca is present in two forms a closed conformation and an open conformation calmodulin reacts with both conformations but reacts faster and with higher affinity for the open conformation measurements of the atpase activity of pmca under similar conditions revealed that the open form has higher atpase activity than the closed one contrasting with the reaction with the whole pump tacalmodulin reacted rapidly in about s with a CBP made T3 the CS of the calmodulinbinding domain of pmca c results of tacalmodulin IB to c are explained by a simpler MM in which only an open conformation exists
AD,aortic diameter,TS-3975,we studied the effect of environmental hypothermia on arterial blood pressure dorsal aortic blood flow and vascular resistance in stage and chick embryos the arterial pressure was measured with a servonull micropressure system mean dorsal aortic blood flow was calculated from pulseddoppler measurement of mean dorsal aortic blood velocity and dorsal AD V1 resistance was calculated by dividing mean vitelline arterial blood pressure by dorsal aortic blood flow sequential data were obtained at temperatures of and degrees c at stage the vitelline arterial blood pressure decreased from means sem to mm hg on cooling and increased from to mm hg on rewarming p less than at stage mean dorsal aortic blood flow decreased from to mms with cooling and increased from to mms with rewarming the V1 resistance in stage embryos increased T3 cooling from to mm hgmms means confidence interval the changes were similar in stage and embryos we conclude that the reduction of vitelline artery blood pressure resulted from a decrease in cardiac SO in addition we noted that the vitelline arterial V1 bed can constrict in response to HT prior to autonomic innervation these changes in hemodynamics may be a teratogenic mechanism for hypothermiainduced cardiac defects in the chick embryo
PG,pyoderma gangrenosum,TS-3976,a yearold man with a mass on the penis and a pain during nighttime erection was referred to our institution tweighted magnetic resonance imaging showed a highintensity area in the dorsal part of CC we diagnosed him with the PA of corpus cavernosum surgical drainage and chemotherapy had been performed for years however it recurred consistently and developed several cutaneous draining CCF the abscess culture was sterile skin biopsy revealed a diagnosis of penile PG which was treated successfully with prednisolone and an IS drug twenty nine cases of the PA of CC have been reported in the literature most of the recurrent cases tend to be idiopathic corpus cavernosum PA with sterile culture and finally penectomy is performed based on this case we propose a new notion that corpus cavernosum abscess can be an early symptom of pyoderma gangrenosum
NP,neuropsychological,TS-3977,patients with psychosis exhibit a wide range of cognitive deficits which are associated with poor functioning and poor outcomes in psychosocial interventions recently VR vr has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for treatment and rehabilitation of these patients we have developed and applied an integrated vr programme to improve social skills in people with schizophrenia the soskitrain the aim of the present study is to evaluate the relationship between patients cognitive deficits their sense of presence and their ratings of the programmes acceptability twelve clinically stabilized outpatients with a wellestablished diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder underwent NP assessment prior to treatment while after the MI they completed a questionnaire about their sense of presence and the acceptability of the vr programme PT results revealed a high sense of presence among patients as well as good verisimilitude and high acceptance of the virtual environments in addition there were significant negative correlations between sense of presence and deficits in both delayed verbal learning and processing speed the paper discusses the implications of cognitive impairment for the experience and acceptance of vr when treating psychotic patients
DI,brattleboro rats,TS-3978,experiments performed on male wistar long evans and DI indicate that the latter strain of animals lacking vasopressin in their posterior pituitaries are extremely CS to hemorrhagic and bowel ICM shock mild forms of both hemorrhagic and bowel ICM shock as produced in wistar or long evans rats results in marked hypotension hemoconcentration and blockade of the RES res in brattleboro animals of similar sex age and weight these direct findings indicate that PR of endogenous vasopressin in shock syndromes may be critical in maintenance of circulatory homeostasis and res function

MS,motion sickness,TS-3980,MS and the antimotion sickness drugs scopolamine scp and promethazine pmz inhibit gastric emptying ge this T0 was conducted to determine if erythromycin would exert its wellknown prokinetic effects in normal and motionsick subjects given antimotion sickness drugs fifteen fasted volunteers males females participated in the study in control tests subjects were given IM im saline sal ml scp mg or pmz mg ge of liquid ml containing mci of tc m DTPA dtpa was measured by sequential gastric scintigraphy T2 after im treatments in other tests ge was measured in subjects T3 each im treatment followed T2 later by mg of erythromycin ethylsuccinate ess suspension given orally in a third group of tests subjects received an im treatment oral ees minutes later and were then brought to an advanced level of motion sickness short of vomiting to induce MS blindfolded subjects made timed head movements while seated in a rotating chair ge was measured immediately after rotation ge halflife rate constant area under the curve auc and lag time were calculated using conventional mathematical methods for analyzing exponential rate processes ge parameters calculated for normal and motionsick subjects given antimotion sickness drugs and ees were compared with those from subjects given im treatments control only in normal subjects ees significantly p increased the ge rate constant for all im treatments and reduced the auc for sal scp and pmz by p p and p respectively in motionsick subjects lag time was significantly p increased and the rate constant and auc values were unchanged from control for all im treatments the authors conclude that oral ees reverses the gastrostatic actions of the antimotion sickness drugs but does not affect the inhibition of GE associated with MS the results suggest that motion sickness and antimotion sickness drugs reduce ge through different mechanisms
NP,neuropathic pain,TS-3981,introduction neuromodulation mediated by invasive electric stimulation has been shown to be ERP when applied to patients with refractory and intractable NP recent advances in neurostimulation have broadened the therapeutic uses of this therapy with the placement of extraspinal electrodes for IP nerve stimulation methods four patients with longevolving persistent severe uncontrolled and localized pain in the occipital region in whom other management options had been tried and failed were treated with a IP occipital extraspinal electric stimulation ccc we present as case reports the results of this MI in these four patients results in all cases stimulation of the occipital region yielded good or very good global results in all patients continuous pain disappeared the frequency and severity of the episodic pain decreased function improved and restful sleep improved as a result of stimulation we were either able to reduce or discontinue medication usage in all of our patients
AV,artificial vagina,TS-3982,frozen feline semen was prepared using two types of extenders egg yolk trisfructose citric acid eytfc and egg yolk sodium citrate solution eyc and the semen qualities after thawing and the conception rates obtained by unilateral intrauterine horn insemination uiui were investigated cats used in the experiment were six males and females aged years the number of experimental cases was for preparation of frozen semen semen collected by the AV method was adjusted to i x spermm and glycerol put in microl straws and then frozen using a cell freezer the mean sperm motility T3 thawing was se in the semen prepared with eytfc and in the semen prepared with eyc four of seven animals were fertilized by uiui using two straws in both extenders and the conception rate was the mean ratios of number of kits to the number of ovulations in the inseminated side were and for eytfc and eyc respectively showing that the ratio tended to be higher in the semen prepared with eytfcnd treatment of pulmonary hypertension over the last decade have markedly improved survival of many patients a targeted approach includes treatment of the underlying disease and therefore requires an extensive evaluation many of the treatment modalities are based on T3 understanding of basic pulmonary vascular biology
LS,laparoscopic splenectomy,TS-3983,singleincision pediatric endosurgery sipes is gaining popularity the aim of this T0 was to review the authors experience with sipes splenectomy and compare it with conventional LS
PS,palmazschatz,TS-3984,minimizing the extent of neointimal proliferation helps to maintain the maximal vessel lumen T3 the treatment of stenosis the present T0 examined AF influencing the predisposition to neointimal proliferation which is a consequence of PS stenting serial IVUS examinations of lesions lesionspatient were performed T3 stenting and at months followup in nonrestenotic patients vessel lumen and stent crosssectional Az csa were measured stenttovessel csa ratio at stenting changes of lumen csa vessel csa and intima csa neointimal proliferation were calculated six months after stenting lumen csa was reduced corresponding to an increase of intima without change of vessel csa without remodeling greater stenttovessel csa at stenting was associated with higher neointimal proliferation at followup the proliferative response was the same at all stent edges stent csa was reduced as stent dilation was increased the stent csa became smaller but stent shrinkage did not account for late lumen loss late lumen loss in stents is the result of neointimal proliferation in cases without restenosis and a larger stenttovessel csa ratio reflects increased neointimal proliferation as shown at month followup
IA,inhibitory avoidance,TS-3985,the present study investigated the involvement of two amygdala pathways the stria terminalis st and the VP amygdalofugal pathway vaf in the effect of posttraining electrical stimulation of the amygdala on retention rats with implanted amygdaloid electrodes and st lesions vaf transections or sham pathway operations were trained on an IA task and an active avoidance task electrical stimulation of the amygdala was given immediately T3 training and PR was tested h later in rats with sham st lesions posttraining amygdaloid stimulation impaired PR in both tasks lesions of the st did not significantly affect retention in the unstimulated rats however the st lesions attenuated the amnestic effect of AM stimulation in rats with sham vaf transections stimulation of the amygdala impaired PR in the IA task but enhanced retention in the AS avoidance task transecting the vaf impaired retention performance of the unstimulated rats in the IA task however the vaf transections did not alter the effect of AM stimulation in both tasks the PR performance of stimulated rats with vaf transections did not differ from that of stimulated rats with sham transections these findings suggest that the st may be involved in mediating the influences of the stimulated amygdala in modulating memory storage processing in the brain
LA,laparoscopic appendectomy,TS-3986,race and insurance status influence the likelihood of undergoing LA la versus OA for the treatment of acute appendicitis we hypothesized that these disparities are caused by presenting hospitals use of la
CT,celiac trunk,TS-3987,we report the case of a yearold man in whom hemorrhage from a ruptured CT pseudoaneurysm which occurred as a consequence of leakage at the site of gastroduodenostomy was successfully controlled by transcatheter arterial embolization tae with SS coils and nbutyl cyanoacrylate nbca the occurrence of a PA of the celiac trunk associated with anastomotic leakage is etiologically rare we compiled reports from the literature on tae for ruptured aneurysms of the CT and compared its therapeutic value with that of surgical treatment operative death occurred in of a series of patients with aneurysms of the CT that were surgically treated in patients with ruptured aneurysms the OM rate was conversely while the unsuccessful rate of tae therapy was the mortality rate was nil the patient whose case is presented here was affected by MR staphylococcus aureus mrsa at the site of leakage and in the lung under septic conditions such as hemorrhage AA to pancreatitis the MR of surgical therapy was whereas the success rate of tae therapy was and the MR was based on these findings it is suggested that tae therapy is a viable alternative to surgery for patients even with ruptured pseudoaneurysms of the CT
MET,motivational enhancement therapy,TS-3988,it is imperative to know what risk factors are more likely to appear during specific developmental stages so that identification and interventions can be used to decrease the risk for future sud continued surveying of risk factors that can occur at any stage in childhood are important to ensure that other risk AF are anticipated and intervened upon as well multiple risk factors increase the magnitude of the risk for sud and therefore all risk factors should be detected to convert these to protective factors screening instruments that can assess risk factors found to increase the risk for substance abuse can be found in examples such as the drug usage screening SF-36 and the problemoriented screening instrument for teenagers the detection of risk AF by primary care providers is becoming increasingly important however other professionals are beginning to recognize that early recognition and treatment can enable a youth to go on to a productive life in other arenas as well drug courts and diversion programs are beginning to treat firsttime offenders and their families rather than taking the punitive RPA these have proven to be very successful PCPs also should become familiar with MET when confronting a youth with a suspected substance abuse problem this method has proven to be more ERP in getting youth into treatment than the direct confrontational style which often puts the youth in a defensive mode MET includes interventions that are delivered in a neutral and empathetic way the six components of motivational enhancement therapy also called frames include feedback on personal impairment emphasis on personal responsibility clear advice to NC menu of alternative options empathy as a counseling style SE in this way a clinician can elicit pros and cons give advice provide choices practice empathy clarify goals and remove barriers this technique allows youth to be less defensive and more proactive monti et al have demonstrated that this technique has been useful in getting youth into treatment PCPs can use instruments that will assess the possibility of both externalizing eg adhd and internalizing eg depression and anxiety disorders examples of this type of instrument are the auchenbach child behavior checklist teacher report form and youth selfreport form which survey symptoms for these disorders social anxiety disorder can be detected by asking whether the prelatency child went into new situations willingly and tended to hang back or whether the child had difficulty separating from his or her parents other questions to ask are whether the child tended to isolate or was fearful of speaking in front of the class of course any bruising or SMB that suggests exposure to adultrelated sexual acts may cause concern for physical or sexual abuse and possible ptsd however interest in sex earlier than expected for the age of the child may also indicate the possibility of bipolar disorder these children have many PS of adhd with a high degree of irritability and may seem boastful or grandiose they may be daredevils with no fear of dangerous consequences referral to a specialist is necessary to evaluate these children further because substance use at age or years can be predicted by academic and social SMB at ages to years early PCD of poor social skills and learning difficulties is essential learning disorders can be uncovered by asking the school to do an DUE however schools having economic problems may not be able to accommodate all requests a parent may have to pay a private provider to complete this workup because insurance companies seldom pay for educational testing learning disorders may go undetected because many school systems opt to use a higher deviation from the fullscale iq to detect learning problems for instance if a student has an iq of the standard nationally recommended deviation from this iq to detect a learning disorder is therefore any child who scores or less on an achievement test should be considered to have a learning disorder some schools prefer to use a deviation of up to so that learning disorders are not detected few schools screen for processing problems including auditory and visual motor processing problems processing speed comprehension and shortterm and LTM problems this is extremely important because adhd can be confused with an AEP processing problem stimulants may help this condition but accommodations must be made to ensure continued success earlyintervention programs such as drug abuse resistance education dare proved to be ineffective because the programs did not target components that have been shown to predict future drug use one program that has targeted these components normative beliefs lifestylebehavior incongruence and commitment is the all stars program a strong initial dosage with booster interventions for at least years is also important before a child is diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder every effort should be made to detect any underlying psychiatric disorder that has not been treated and therefore may look like a conduct disorder eg BP disorder proper psychopharmacologic interventions should be made for psychiatric disorders if one drug has been ineffective another untreated psychiatric disorder may be present and it is always important to tease out what remaining PS are present T3 a therapeutic trial has been tried it is important to form a team RPA so that all risk AF can be approached members of the team often include a PC physician a child psychologist the parents the patient a teacher a school counselor a child psychiatrist and sometimes a pediatric neurologist no one member of the treatment team can provide all of the necessary services to prevent the future risk for SA
TA,tunica albuginea,TS-3989,cysts of the TA are uncommon lesions of the testis which in all reported cases have been benign complex cysts of the tunica albuginea can mimic intratesticular lesions thus necessitating orchiectomy we present a case of a complex TA cyst which mimicked an intratesticular lesion at sonography as well as at magnetic resonance imaging mri tangential views however suggested that this was in fact an extratesticular lesion the use of tangential views as well as knowledge of the appearance of the tunica albuginea at mri are important to make this differentiation in order to guide the management of these lesions to our knowledge this is the first case in which the appearance of a tunica albuginea cyst at mri has been described
DSP,digital signal processor,TS-3990,a new system has been developed to assess human alertness and to alert the subject with acoustic stimulation in accordance with the assessed level of alertness dynamic characteristics of saccadic EM saccade sc were used to calculate an alertness index DSP was adopted for the calculation the system was tested through eye tracking tasks the results indicated that the developed system could awaken the subject by FF sound back to the subject also arousal reaction induced by the sound was visualized quantitatively by analyzing values of the alertness index T3 the stimulation these results indicate applicability of the system not only to awakening device for accident prevention but also to a tool for investigating effects of the stimulation
MS,mass spectrometer,TS-3991,this is a followup paper of our previous report on an ion source which was operated at an operating pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure besides having more working gas for desolvation the reduction of mean free path of electrons in a higher pressure environment increases the threshold voltage for gaseous breakdown thus enabling a SD electrospray for the sample solution with high surface tension without the occurrence of electric discharge in our previous work the ion source was not coupled directly to the MS and significant amount of ions were lost before entering the vacuum of the MS in this paper we report the new design of our second prototype in which by using a modified ion transport capillary the pressurized esi ion source was coupled directly to the first pumping stage of the MS without additional modification on the vacuum pumping system demonstrations of the new ion source on the CS detection of native proteins from aqueous solution in both positive and negative ion modes are presented
SS,salbutamol sulfate,TS-3992,the development of new thrombolytic agents is concentrating on substances which are more ERP and more fibrin specific than streptokinase prourokinase is a single chain urokinasetype plasminogen activator scupa the recombinant unglycosylated prourokinase saruplase is synthesized in transformed e coli bacteria the dominant half life is minutes with the standard dosage regimen about of saruplase is converted into two chain uPA tcupa which is rapidly inactivated by plasma inhibitors whereas saruplase is not saruplase is fibrinspecific since it predominantly activates plasminogen bound to fibrin even without measurable conversion to tcupa saruplase appears able to activate Fn the Fn TPS action is dose dependent and correlates inversely with the rate of saruplase converted to tcupa dose finding studies have shown that a mg bolus followed by mg given intravenously over minutes is an effective thrombolytic regimen in the passstudy patients were treated with saruplase the results of the passstudy table confirmed the efficacy and safety of the mg dosage this standard dosage has been compared with streptokinase urokinase and alteplase in randomized multicenterstudies the systemic FA is less in comparison to streptokinase but higher than the SVR FA of tPA in the primstudy the early patency T2 was significantly higher with saruplase in comparison to streptokinase figure patency T3 minutes and to hours did not differ significantly between botnt in fev and pefr but the NC was statistically significant only in pefr at minutes p five children experienced mild tremors there were no significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure at any dose it is concluded that a nebulized solution of SS at a dose of mgkg is useful for treatment of asthma in thai children with very mild side effects
AR,apoptotic rate,TS-3993,valdecoxib is a second generation selective cox inhibitor that can induce cell apoptosis in a variety of cell types but its precise regulatory mechanism is unknown apoptosis of eca cells and p mrna expression were investigted the expression of ppmapk fas and fasl proteins were detected by immunohistochemical IF and fcm valdecoxib increased the apoptosis rate of eca cells fas and fasl protein expression was upregulated in the valdecoxib groups while sb partly inhibited the valdecoxibinduced overexpression valdecoxib increased pmapk expression while sb inhibited the overexpression of this protein and the apoptosis rate decreased the expression of fas fasl and pmapk protein were positively correlated with the AR in conclusion valdecoxib activates the pmapk pathway thus upregulating expression of the fas and fasl proteins which may be one of the mechanisms through which valdecoxib induces apoptosis
SAC,staphylococcus aureus cowan,TS-3994,the effects of purified protein a from SAC i stain on induction of lymphokine il activated killer lak activity were studied in normal as well as melanoma patients lymphocyte the coculture of IP blood MNC cells pbmc with various doses of protein a and microgramml and il uml for days produced synergistic effect on the lak cells mediated cytotoxicity the potentiation of cytotoxicity and lytic ability of lak cells against nk CS k and nkresistant m tumor cells were observed further there was potentiation of dna synthesis in pbmc after days SC similar results were found when pbmc from melanoma patients were cultured with pa and il the potentiation of lak cell induction associated with its cytotoxic and lytic potential by low doses of ilpa regiment may be helpful in the development of lak immunotherapy of the CA patients
CI,cytoplasmic incompatibility,TS-3995,endosymbiotic bacteria of the genus wolbachia are widespread among arthropods and cause a variety of reproductive abnormalities such as CI thelytokous parthenogenesis malekilling and host feminization in this study we used three sets of wolbachiaspecific primers s rdna ftsz and wsp in conjunction with the PCR reaction pcr cloning and sequencing to T0 the infection of fruit flies anastrepha spp and ceratitis capitata by wolbachia the flies were collected at several localities in brazil and at guayaquil ecuador all of the fruit flies studied were infected with wolbachia supergroup a in PA with the high prevalence of this group in south america phylogenetic analysis showed that the wsp gene was the most CS gene for studying the relationships among wolbachia strains the wolbachia sequences detected in these fruit flies were similar to those such as wmel reported for other fruit flies these results show that the infection of anastrepha fruit flies by wolbachia is much more widespread than previously thought
MCP,multicatalytic proteinase,TS-3996,the s proteasome MCP was purified from maize zea mays l cv dea roots through a fivestep procedure T3 PSA characterization it was shown to be similar to most eukaryotic proteasomes we investigated the involvement of the s proteasome in the response to carbon starvation in excised maize root tips using polyclonal antibodies we showed that the amount of proteasome increased in hcarbonstarved root tips compared with freshly excised tips whereas the mrna C2 of alpha and beta subunits of s proteasome decreased moreover in carbonstarved tissues chymotrypsinlike and caseinolytic MICs of the s proteasome were found to increase whereas trypsinlike MICs decreased the measurement of TPS activities and kinetic parameters of s proteasome purified from hstarved root tips suggested that it was subjected to posttranslational modifications using dinitrophenylhydrazine a carbonylspecific reagent we observed an increase in carbonyl residues in s proteasome purified from starved root tips this means that s proteasome was oxidized during starvation treatment moreover an in vitro mild oxidative treatment of s proteasome from nonstarved material resulted in the activation of chymotrypsinlike peptidylglutamylpeptide hydrolase and caseinolyticspecific activities and in the inhibition of trypsinlike specific MICs similar to that observed for proteasome from starved root tips our results provide the first evidence to our knowledge for an in vivo carbonylation of the s proteasome they suggest that sugar ED induces an oxidative stress and that oxidized s proteasome could be associated to the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins in carbon starvation situations
SI,stress incontinence,TS-3997,patients with SI who were waiting for operative treatment tested specially designed vaginal tampons the tampons ten per patient were tested in situations where the patients normally would experience urinary leakage of the patients afterwards answered a questionnaire patients had experienced CR continence and in seven patients the use of the tampon had reduced leakage nine patients wanted to continue using tampons until the T0 we believe that vaginal tampons by eliminating odour and a feeling of wetness may be a better aid than pads for certain women with stress incontinence
CM,medium conditioned,TS-3998,interactions of interstitial fibroblasts with nearby epithelial cells are thought to play a role in lung growth and development the present studies support this premise CM by secondpassage lung fibroblasts fcm stimulated both dna synthesis and accumulation in lowdensity x cm cultures of type ii AM epithelial cells fcm effects did not require serum they were time and dose dependent with halfmaximal fcm activity at dilution a maximal response to fcm required h of SE fcm activity was reduced in medium from fibroblasts treated with dexamethasone suggesting physiological regulation ATII subjected to cyclic mechanical AS demonstrated an increased response to fcm compared with static cultures fcm activity did not appear to be accounted for by hepatocyte growth factor keratinocyte growth factor acidic fibroblast growth factor or fibronectin these results suggest that early passage lung fibroblasts PR by regulated pathways one or more AF that stimulate dna synthesis by ATII sensitivity to fcm appears to be elevated in type ii cell cultures subjected to cyclic mechanical stress
GS,glucosamine sulfate,TS-3999,this review summarizes recent knowledge on the tau of glucosamine gs andor chondroitin sulfate cs in the therapy of mild to moderate osteoarthritis oa oa the most common joint disease is a significant source of disability quality of life impairment and a considerable burden to any health care system in the czech republic GS gs and chondroitin sulfate cs are available both as prescription drugs and as food supplements based on available data both are useful in the earlier stages of oa when combined with other modalities such as WL and exercises they appear to relieve pain and improve range of the joint motion in addition they also display mild antiinflammatory effects however controversy still exists over their ability to NC significantly the natural PH of the osteoarthritic joint this effect is not easy to demonstrate for any other treatment modalities apart from joint replacement monitoring the cure efficacy by xray has been recently criticised and hence future techniques are anticipated for this reason further LT oral administration is required to obtain slightly increased C2 of gs andor cs in human blood both reviewed saccharides are well tolerated with negligible adverse reactions in conclusion the authors suggest that gs and cs should be classified as food supplements only
PF,pancreatic fistula,TS-4000,a PF is one of the most serious complications in DP with en bloc celiac axis resection dpcar because the pancreatic transection is performed on the right side of the portal vein which results in a large crosssection surface and because postpancreatectomy hemorrhage is hard to treat by interventional radiology therefore a procedure to decrease the incidence of postoperative PF is urgently needed
CA,condylomata acuminata,TS-4001,using the HC method CA from healthy patients controls and patients with altered cellmediated immunity were analyzed for multiple human papillomavirus hpv dna and of lesions from controls and patients respectively were hpv dnapositive only with probes for lowrisk hpv types p using probes for both low and highrisk hpv types and of lesions from controls and patients respectively were positive for both probes p evidence of multiple hpv types was also found by SB and in situ hybridization studies the mean hpv copy number detected by either probe did not differ significantly among patient groups using CS techniques such as hybrid capture multiple hpv types including those associated with genital malignancy can be detected in CA serial biopsies demonstrate the dynamic nature of genital hpv infection and that changes in the predominant hpv types may be reflected in tissue pathology
BR,bed rest,TS-4002,the results of treatment in two groups of patients with calvÃ©leggperthes disease are compared one group having received conservative treatment consisting of BR and avoidance of weightbearing and the other operative treatment consisting of a subtrochanteric varusrotational osteotomy without any restrictions of PCS activity after healing of the osteotomy in both CG the femoral head destruction was classified according to catterall and thus the operatively treated group on the whole had more seriously affected hips than the conservatively treated group although the main advantage of operative treatment is the short period of time spent in bed and the otherwise unrestricted physical activity the results showed very little difference between the degree of femoral head congruity the covering of the head by the acetabulum and the preservation of LL and hip motility T3 operative as compared with CT a retardation of skeletal maturity is present particularly in patients with bilateral affections
PC,peritoneal carcinomatosis,TS-4003,gastrointestinal HM frequently recur with M1 limited to the ABD cavity due to full thickness penetration of tumor through bowel wall and spillage of RT from lymphatic channels by surgical trauma RT cells are disseminated throughout the peritoneal surfaces either prior to at the time of surgical removal of the primary tumor diagnosis of recurrent cancer is difficult because no CS diagnostic test is available by which to image a small tumor volume present on peritoneal surfaces computerized tomography can not demonstrate small to moderate nodules intraperitoneal instillation of labeled monoclonal antibody has allowed visualization of mucinous RT on peritoneal surfaces not seen by any other radiologic test IPC has been shown to provide palliation in patients with small volume disease confined to peritoneal surfaces because of limited penetration of chemotherapy into large RT nodules this treatment strategy has not been effective for bulky intraabdominal recurrent cancer cytoreductive surgery can make patients relatively disease free new surgical technologies combined with postoperative IPC have been shown to be curative for selected patients with recurrent cystadenocarcinoma the wider application of immediate postoperative IPC treatments for gastrointestinal patients in an adjuvant setting may be of value in preventing the occurrence of PC and in improving survival
SE,squalene epoxidase,TS-4004,the program hypoopt in combination with the msi program citest has been used to optimise and expand d qsar catalyst hypotheses using simplex optimisation coupled with crossvalidation three data sets related to angiotensin CE inhibition SE inhibition and hiv protease inhibition were used to investigate the outcome of hypothesis optimisation simplex optimisation using leaveoneout crossvalidation during the hypothesis refinement resulted in improved models with respect to predictivity of an external test set furthermore the utilisation of the geometry of the AS site for the hiv protease inhibitors represented by catalyst excluded volume features resulted in an optimised hypothesis with improved predictivity compared with the corresponding hypothesis derived without receptor information
BS,body surface,TS-4005,the twocompound ointment taclonexdaivobetdovobet ointment combining calcipotriene microgg and betamethasone mgg as dipropionate is very effective in the treatment of PS vulgaris there is a possibility that hypothalamopituitaryaxis hpa suppression may occur if the potent corticosteroid component is absorbed to a sufficient extent the effect of the twocompound ointment on hpa axis function was assessed in two studies study was a fourweek doubleblind study which compared the effects of the twocompound ointment with betamethasone mgg as dipropionate diprosone ointment in patients with extensive PS involving of the BS area no patients receiving the twocompound ointment had hpa axis suppression study assessed hpa axis function after four and weeks in a subset of patients n participating in a longterm safety T0 patients were treated with the twocompound ointment for the first four weeks followed by weeks of treatment as needed with either twocompound ointment twocompound ointment alternating with calcipotriene fourweekly or calcipotriene no patients using the twocompound ointment for all weeks or AC fourweekly with calcipotriene had hpa axis suppression
AC,allergic conjunctivitis,TS-4006,to evaluate plasma hydroxyvitamin d and serum total immunoglobulin e ige C2 in patients with seasonal AC sac
BP,basilar papilla,TS-4007,we are currently removing the single middle ear bone columella in the domestic chick to introduce chemical agents directly into the inner ear since we are interested in the effect of these agents on neural structures within the avian basilar papilla bp we are concerned about any subtle changes that might result from the surgical procedure of columella removal CT the purpose of this study was to use light and transmission electron microscopy to analyze morphological changes in the inner ear after columella removal fifteendayold chicks underwent a unilateral BL or a sham removal of the columella after columella removal the oval window was either plugged with gelfoam or kimwipe standard accepted procedure to prevent possible PL leak or left uncovered after a day survival period morphological changes were observed in the tegmentum vasculosum tv of all ears receiving a columella removal as compared to unoperated ears further ears with gelfoam plugging the oval window also had damage to the hair cells and support cells of the BP in contrast there were no observable differences in either AEP afferent or efferent nerve terminals on hair cells in the bp from any ears that had the columella removed compared to those from unoperated ears these results suggest that columella removal alone may produce morphological changes to the tv within days of surgery but not to structures within the bp on the other hand columella removal with a gelfoam plug results in damage not only to the tv but also to cells within the BP during this same survival time despite damage to other structures within the inner ear cochlear efferent and afferent terminals on surviving hair cells were unaffected by columella removal with or without plugging
LT,lactate threshold,TS-4008,the fastest growing age group in the united states and japan is the elderly there is a need to develop AGA exercise training guidelines designed specifically for healthy older persons recent reports have shown that the LT lt can be used to evaluate the clinical significance of aerobic SP vomax and its effect of exercise training in the elderly however there is a lack of research comparing the lt between welltrained and sedentary elderly individuals also the effect of exercise training on the HR rate hr at lt needs further investigation the purpose of this study was to compare the lt levels between the older TR men t group n age yr range yr and apparently healthy but untrained elderly men u group n age yr range yr the lt was measured during an incremental cycle ergometer test a low relationship was found between vo corresponding to lt volt and age in the t r p and u groups r p a significant difference was found in the volt between the t and u CG the absolute volt corresponded to approximately and mets for the t and u subjects respectively however there was no significant difference in hr corresponding to lt hrlt between the two groups t bmin u bmin the data show that the absolute volt is higher for t than u elderly subjects and is associated with a hr of approximately bmin for both groups recommended exercise intensity in terms of hr may not differ between TR and UT elderly men
PF,plasma fibrinogen,TS-4009,we examined whether nitrolargininemethyl ester lname causes a sustained elevation in PF concentration in rats oral dosing of lname mgkg per day for days significantly raised PFC in rats the increase in plasma fibrinogen however returned to control levels by the treatment for more than days in spite of progressive hypertension candesartan failed to reverse the transient hyperfibrinogenemia indicating that the rise in plasma fibrinogen may occur through the mechanisms other than angiotensin ii receptor activation these data suggest that a prolonged lname treatment does not cause chronic hyperfibrinogenemia in rats
FM,fish meal,TS-4010,this study examined the effects of substituting fish oil and FM with a blend of LNA ala n rich vegetable oils ww and defatted poultry meal ww in a formulated diet on growth and tissue HFA profiles in barramundi fingerlings results indicated that on average while the ala levels of the barramundi liver and fillet increased with increasing dietary ala there was no corresponding increase in the levels of the omega n long chain PUFA fatty acid lcpufa compared to fish consuming a commercial feed which contained fish meal and FO fish on the ala diets grew slower had a lower feed NI and lower n lcpufa C2 in the tissues hepatic mrna expression of Î´ desaturase fads and elongase elovl was fold and fold higher respectively in all the ala dietary groups relative to those fed the commercial feed however the level of expression of the two genes was not different between fish fed differing ala levels these data demonstrate that increasing the ala level of the diet is not an AGA strategy for replacing marine sources of n lcpufa in barramundi it was also noted however that within the different ala dietary CG there was a large amount of variation between individual fish in their tissue dha C2 suggesting a significant heterogeneity in their capacity for conversion of ala andor PR of n lcpufa when dietary ala intakes were greater than en tissue dha C2 were inversely related to ala intake suggesting that high intake of dietary ala may inhibit dha synthesis
GM,gastrocnemius muscle,TS-4011,indirect IFA of different rat skeletal muscles using antimyosin heavy chain mhc monoclonal antibodies mab revealed the presence of two immunologically distinct kinds of fibers within the iib SF histochemically identified by S1 atpase IF some iib fibers designated here as iib were unreactive with one antifast mhc mab whereas they did react with another antifast mhc mab other iib SF designated here as iib reacted with both antifast mabs neither of the two iib fiber subtypes was significantly reactive with a neonatal mhc mab the number of each iib fiber subtype was agedependent at least in the plantaris muscle iib SF were observed only in the SF portion of the plantaris and GM the ratio of iibiib fibers was about the same throughout the extensor digitorum longus and extraocular muscles therefore the two kinds of iib fibers here observed have a different myosin heavy chain content on the basis of their specific immunoreactivities we suggest that iib fibers contain the previously described mhcb iib fibers contain either a unique new mhc isoform or a mixture of at least two mhc possibly composed of the mhcb and either the previously described mhca or a new mhc isoform
TA,transactivation,TS-4012,functional short TRs str are polymorphic in the population and the number of repeats regulates the expression of nearby genes known as expression str estr str in igf promoter has been extensively studied for its association with igf concentration in blood and various clinical traits and represents an important estr we previously used an invitro luciferase reporter model to examine the interaction between strs and snps in igf promoter here we further explored the mechanism how the number of repeats of the str regulates gene transcription an inverse correlation between the number of repeats and the extent of transactivation was found in a haplotype consisting of three promoter snps cstrtt we showed that these adjacent snps located outside the str were required for the str to function as estr the c allele of rs provides a IB site for ccaatenhancerbindingprotein Î´ cebpd which is essential for the gradational TA property of estr and foxa may also be involved therefore we propose a mechanism in which the gradational transactivation by the estr is caused by the interaction of one or more transcriptional complexes located outside the str rather than by direct IB to a repeat motif of the str
ROC,receptoroperated channels,TS-4013,the effects of normal human Pr plasma on the CR of rabbit aortic rings with documented endothelium have been studied the rings were incubated in plasma from either normal pregnant or nonpregnant women and the effects of incubation on their responses to noradrenaline na calcium chloride stimulation and potassium chlorideinduced EC50 were examined there was no significant difference in the responses to na in rings incubated in plasma from either Pr or nonpregnant women the responses of the rings incubated in both types of plasma to calcium chloride stimulation through ROC were similar but rings incubated in plasma from pregnant women demonstrated decreased sensitivity and +dP/dt to calcium chloride stimulation through voltage operated channels potassium chlorideinduced EC50 was significantly enhanced in rings incubated in plasma from normal Pr women the pattern of the responses was unaltered by either deendothelialization or i.c.v. of the rings with indomethacin the effects of plasma from Pr women are similar to what has been reported as characteristic of vascular smooth muscle in NP
AP,alternative pathway,TS-4014,decayaccelerating factor daf cd is a glycophosphatidyl inositolanchored glycoprotein that regulates the activity of c and c convertases in addition to understanding the mechanism of complement inhibition by daf through structural studies there is also an interest in the possible therapeutic potential of the molecule in this report we describe the cloning expression in escherichia coli isolation and membranetargeting modification of the four short consensus repeat domains of soluble human daf with an additional cterminal cysteine residue to permit sitespecific modification the purified refolded recombinant protein was AS against both CP and AP assays of complement activation and had similar biological activity to soluble human daf expressed in pichia pastoris modification with a membranelocalizing peptide restored cell IB and gave a C1 increase in antihemolytic potency these data suggested that the recombinant daf was correctly folded and suitable for structural studies as well as being the basis for a dafderived therapeutic crystals of the e coliderived protein were obtained and diffracted to a thus permitting the first detailed xray crystallography studies on a functionally active human complement regulator protein with direct therapeutic potential
RF,restricted feeding,TS-4015,the effect of excess amino acids on utilization of the most limiting CAA was investigated via restricted feeding lysine and threoninedeficient CAA mixtures were incorporated into diets for young growing rats to provide or of the nrc requirement of the limiting amino acid in combination with zero or of relative excess of the nonlimiting amino acids the amount of food offered was equalized within treatment CG and increased according to the NI of the group with the lowest rate of consumption because of differences in the amount of diet refused total food intakes were not MZ at equal percentage of the nrc requirement threonine and lysinedeficient CAA mixtures supported equal body weight DM lipid and ash gains however crude protein retention was greater when the threoninedeficient CAA mixture was fed the maximum depression in performance due to of amino acid excess with RF was much less than the maximum decrease previously observed in the ad libitum feeding situation this supports the conclusion that changes in VFI are the major effectors of depressed growth due to excess amino acids these results raise serious concern over the usefulness of CAA requirements and the applicability of the current system of chemical scores to evaluate protein quality

SL,scapholunate,TS-4025,several radiologic measurement methods have been described for determining static carpal alignment of the wrist these include the SL radiolunate and capitolunate angles the triangulation method is an alternative radiologic measurement which we believe is easier to use and more reproducible and reliable than the above mentioned methods the purpose of this T0 is to assess the intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver reliability of the triangulation method scapholunate radiolunate and capitolunate angles twenty orthopaedic residents and staff at varying C2 of training made four radiologic measurements including the SL radiolunate and capitolunate angles as well as the triangulation method on five different lateral digitized radiographs of the wrist and forearm in neutral radioulnar deviation thirty days after the initial measurements the participants repeated the four radiologic measurements using the same radiographs the triangulation method had the best intraandinterobserver PA of the four methods tested this PA was significantly better than the capitolunate and radiolunate angles the SL angle had the next best intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver reliability the triangulation method has the best overall observer PA when compared to the SL radiolunate and capitolunate angles in determining static midcarpal alignment no comment can be made on the validity of the measurements since there is no radiographic gold standard in determining static carpal alignment
EO,electric organ,TS-4026,r from bovine brain CBF SC purification of both enzymes included chromatography on concanavalin asepharose and ampsepharose the contribution to the total of soluble CEA was lower in EO than in bovine CBF SC MB and soluble forms have very similar km values for amp and are inhibited by micromolar concentrations of atp both forms crossreact with and are inhibited by an antibody against the MB surfacelocated ecto nucleotidase from electric organ the hnk carbohydrate epitope is present on both forms of the torpedo enzyme but is entirely absent from bovine cerebralcortex nucleotidase an antibody specific for the Ins cyclicmonophosphate that is formed on phospholipase c cleavage of an IN glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi anchor binds to the soluble but not to the membranebound form of the enzyme from both sources our results suggest that soluble lowkm nucleotidase in both EO and bovine brain is derived from the MB gpianchored form of the enzyme by the action of a phospholipase c and is not a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme
BSM,bronchial smooth muscle,TS-4027,calcitonin generelated peptide cgrp is a potent vasodilator peptide present in capsaicinsensitive SN innervating the respiratory tract in this T0 the ARG distribution of icgrp IB CS was investigated in guinea pig airways extremely dense TPS binding occurred over parenchymal tissue with moderate SB over tracheal PG the endothelium of pulmonary veins and arteries and small blood vessels in the bronchial wall the localization of binding sites for icgrp over blood vessels but not BSM correlates well with the physiological actions of this peptide although the function of the PC sites is unknown no significant difference in binding was seen in vehicle or capsaicinpretreated animals suggesting that sites are not reliant on AF from capsaicinsensitive SN

SP,social phobia,TS-4032,though there is a considerable amount of research supporting the association between stressful life events and L1 depression there is a paucity of research concerning a range of other life stress constructs nondepressive disorders the role of SD personality traits and gender differences this T0 addresses these deficits by a focusing on the association between interpersonal and noninterpersonal chronic life stress cls and both depressive and anxiety disorders b examining the roles of neuroticism and low extraversion in these associations and c assessing gender differences participants were adolescents from a study examining risk AF for emotional disorders depression and social phobia were associated with interpersonal cls ipcls with neuroticism partially accounting for these associations low extraversion partially accounted for the association between SP and ipcls depression was also associated with noninterpersonal cls nicls but only in females this T0 provides preliminary evidence for the importance of personality variables in explaining shared associations between stress and depression additionally the stresssocial phobia relationship is highlighted with no evidence supporting an association between other anxiety disorders and cls
BF,biceps femoris,TS-4033,neurological disorders such as stroke impair locomotor control and result in abnormal d gait kinematics establishment of effective rehabilitation strategies requires an understanding of how individual muscles contribute to pathological movement forward dynamic simulations account for complexities of interjoint coupling and can be used to predict dynamic muscle function however to date limited experimental validations of dynamic models have been performed our objective was to measure d movement induced by the BF bf rectus femoris rf and vastus lateralis vl in limb configurations corresponding to the swing phase of gait and to assess the biomechanical AF that affect dynamic CF subjects were positioned in a robotic gait orthosis that included a compliant interface electrical stimulation was introduced into individual muscles while induced hip and knee joint movements were recorded measured hip to knee sagittal plane acceleration ratios were consistent with dynamic musculoskeletal MM simulations however rf and vl induced substantially larger frontal plane hip movements than modelbased predictions sensitivity analyses on MSK MM parameters revealed that muscle CF depends primarily on moment arm assumptions though generic musculoskeletal models are suitable for predicting sagittal plane muscle CF improvements in moment arm accuracy are essential for investigation of d pathological gait
TF,transfer function,TS-4034,nonlinear transformation is one of the major obstacles to analyzing the properties of multilayer perceptrons in this letter we prove that the correlation coefficient between two jointly gaussian random variables decreases when each of them is transformed under continuous nonlinear transformations which can be approximated by piecewise linear functions when the inputs or the weights of a multilayer perceptron are perturbed randomly the weighted sums to the hidden SN are asymptotically jointly gaussian random variables since sigmoidal transformation can be approximated piecewise linearly the correlations among the weighted sums decrease under sigmoidal transformations based on this result we can say that sigmoidal transformation used as the TF of the multilayer perceptron reduces redundancy in the information contents of the hidden SN

LT,light transmittance,TS-4038,polylhistidinepolyethylene glycol diblock copolymers polyhisbpeg were prepared and used for the construction of polymeric micelles responding to local ph changes in the body polyhis was synthesized by ring opening polymerization of lhistidine ncarboxyanhydride the imidazole amine group of which was protected by the DNP group the resulting CP mn gmole was coupled to PE glycol mn gmole via an NH linkage using the DCCD and nhydroxysuccinimidemediated reaction the block copolymer in dimethyl sulfoxide formed polymeric micelles on diafiltration against a borate buffer at ph dynamic CS scattering and atomic force microscopy showed the micelles were spherical diameter approximately nm with a unimodal distribution the critical micelle concentration cmc at ph was mgl the cmc increased markedly on decreasing the ph of the diafiltration medium below micelles prepared at ph were gradually destabilized below ph as evidenced by a slight increase in LT an alteration in size distribution and a decrease in the Py FI it was concluded that the ionization of the polyhis block forming the micelle core determined the phdependent cmc and stability after further optimization of the phsensitivity phsensitive micelles are expected to have application for solid tumor treatment exploiting the fact that most ST have an acidic extracellular ph
CA,constitutively active,TS-4039,the pharmacology antimicrobial activity pharmacokinetics clinical tau and adverse effects of linezolid are reviewed linezolid the only oxazolidinone antimicrobial approved for use in the united states has significant activity against GP bacteria including penicillin cephalosporin and vancomycinresistant species linezoliovirus encoding antisense mlck cdna adgfpas mlck or a dominantnegative ec mlck construct ec mlckatpdel resulted in marked reductions in mlck activity and tnfalphamediated apoptosis in contrast a CA ec mlck lacking the carboxylterminal autoinhibitory domains ec mlck markedly enhanced the AI response to TNF IS in gfpec mlckexpressing cells revealed colocalization of caspase and ec mlck along actin SFs after tnfalpha TNF induced the caspasedependent cleavage of ec mlck in transfected EC cells which was confirmed by mass spectroscopy with in vitro cleavage by caspase at lkkd d the resulting mlck fragments displayed significant calmodulinindependent kinase activity these studies convincingly demonstrate that novel interactions between the AI machinery and ec mlck exist that regulate the endothelial contractile apparatus in tnfalphainduced apoptosis
SG,stratum granulosum,TS-4040,SNs expressing the mrgprd receptor are known to innervate the outermost living layer of the epidermis the SG the sensory modality that these neurons signal and the stimulus that they respond to are not established although immunocytochemical data suggest they could be nonpeptidergic nociceptors using patch clamp of dissociated mouse DRG drg neurons the present T0 demonstrates that mrgprd neurons have several properties typical of nociceptors longduration action potentials ttxresistant na current and ca currents that are inhibited by mu opioids remarkably mrgprd SN respond almost exclusively to extracellular atp with currents similar to homomeric px receptors they show little or no sensitivity to other putative nociceptive agonists including capsaicin cinnamaldehyde menthol ph or glu these properties together with selective innervation of the stratum granulosum indicate that mrgprd neurons are nociceptors in the outer epidermis and may respond indirectly to external stimuli by detecting atp PR in the skin
GT,germ tube,TS-4041,due to the augmented number of ICP the infections associated to the pathogen of the genus candida have increased dramatically in the recent years in order to proliferate CA can produce a germ tube formation extending from the cells the GT formation is a TS from budding to hyphal cells and represents an essential stage for virulence in this work we studied the effect of the photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy pact a potential antimicrobial treatment on the germ tube formation by c albicans GT formation was induced by goat SS T3 different treatments with methylene blue mb and laser nm our results demonstrated that photodynamic therapy using mb as a photosensitizing drug inhibits both the growth and the GT formation by c albicans thus our results suggest the possibility that methylene blue combined with CS in a TPS wavelength can be used as a promising novel antifungal agent
AP,alpha antiplasmin,TS-4042,the effects of alpha AP and fibrin on the activation of plasminogen by recombinant staphylokinase star were studied in an effort to elucidate further the molecular basis of the fibrinspecificity of this fibrinolytic agent in purified systems consisting of mumoll intact or lowmr plasminogen and mumoll AP at degrees c and in the absence of Fn star did not induce PA and PAP pap formation addition of a purified Fn clot vol at a concentration of mgml to mixtures containing intact plasminogen caused approximately PA within hours whereas in mixtures containing lowmr plasminogen no activation was observed in contrast nmoll streptokinase sk induced to plasminogen activation within hours in mixtures containing either IN or lowmr plasminogen in both the absence and the presence of Fn in citrated HP in the absence of Fn nmoll star did not induce measurable plasminogen activation and pap formation within hours whereas addition of a plasma clot vol resulted in CR clot lysis and conversion of of the plasminogen to pap within hours addition of a second plasma clot produced additional plasminogen activation equipotent concentrations for plasma clot lysis of sk nmoll induced PA in the absence and in the presence of fibrin addition of mmoll aminohexanoic acid aha abolished the effect of fibrin on PA with star but not on activation with sk in alpha antiplasmindepleted human plasma in the absence of Fn nmoll star did not induce fibrinogen breakdown residual fibrinogen T3 hours whereas nmoll preformed plasminstar complex induced extensive fibrinogen degradation within T2 thus in the absence of fibrin AP inhibits the activation of plasminogen by star by preventing generation of AS plasminstar complex fibrin stimulates PA by star via mechanisms involving the lysinebinding sites of plasminogen probably by facilitating the generation of plasminstar complex and by delaying its inhibition at the clot surface

GI,global ischemia,TS-4045,acute myocardial ischemia leads to a gradual increase in betaadrenergic receptors at the cell surface this increase occurs rapidly after onset of global ischemia T2 and persists even after prolonged periods of global ischemia this alteration can be observed both in vivo and in vitro in isolated perfused hearts several groups have previously shown that ischemia induces a local PR of endogenous catecholamines here we show that these endogenous catecholamines are sufficiently high to induce receptor desensitization with internalization of betaadrenergic receptors in normal NF in acute myocardial ischemia however agonistpromoted internalization and PET uncoupling of betaadrenergic receptors is abolished consequently the balance of internalization and externalization of receptors is shifted toward an increase in functionally coupled receptors at the cell surface similarly but inconsistently the density of alpha adrenergic receptors in the BPM is increased in acute MI in regard to function the increase of coupled betaadrenergic receptors leads to an augmented responsiveness of the aca system to betaadrenergic stimulation this receptorspecific sensitization is superimposed by a transient increase of total aca activity in the very early phase of GI minutes the enhanced activity of aca to direct stimulation is tightly associated with the partially purified enzyme suggesting a covalent modification of the enzyme molecule however after prolonged periods greater than T2 of GI the ischemiainduced enzymespecific sensitization is displaced by a GA reduction in CEA both in vivo and in vitro the persistent sensitization at the receptor level then meets an unresponsive adenylyl cyclaseabstract truncated at words

HC,home care,TS-4058,in the andersennewman MM utilization of medical services behavior affected by the three AF of need enabling and predisposing many studies on medical services SMB adapting this model obtained the same results our T0 aimed to describe the difference of insured and noninsured patients using HC to examine the AF that explain the LT utilization of HC by using andersennewman MM and to survey the expenditure on HC our study collected cases by questionnaires through home interview from various HC units from sep to dec the response rate was chisquare and multiple regression tests from sas computer program performed data analysis our results showed there was a significant difference in four months utilization between insured and noninsured patients month vs month p however if the utilization number per month was less than two no significance between the two groups was found regarding utilization behavior in home care there were some differences among the need enabling and predisposing AF our findings demonstrated young patients patients with chronic illness and the fukienese with families involving for care were willing to pay for home care despite the fact that they did not have full support from the family the determining AF affecting LT utilization of home care were the fukienese patients owning an independent house patients with SHI and patients who lived in mid or easttaiwan in addition patients with an elevated number of utilizations per month and poor daily activity used home care all dependent variables could explain of variance the results proposed to the authorities concerned health institutions and medical professionals for REF in developing HC program
PE,pharyngoesophageal,TS-4059,pharyngoesophageal perforation T3 anterior cervical spine surgery is rare and the delayed cases were more rarely reported but potentially lifethreatening we report a case of PE perforation years after anterior C2 spine surgery the patient presented with dysphagia fever left cervical mass and developing dyspnea years after C2 spine surgery for trauma T3 careful examinations he underwent an emergency tracheostomy neck exploration hardware removal abscess drainage and INF tissue debridement days after surgery ct of the neck with oral contrast demonstrated no contrast extravasation from the esophagus upon review of literature only cases of PE perforation more than year after anterior cervical spine surgery were found we discussed possible etiology diagnosis and management and concluded that in cases of dysphagia dyspnea C2 pain swelling and edema of the C2 area even long time T3 anterior cervical spine surgery potential pharyngoesophageal damage should be considered
DBN,downbeat nystagmus,TS-4060,cell CG of the paramedian tract which are located in the paramedian region of the lower brainstem are eyemovementrelated neurons that project to the cerebellar flocculus their inactivation produces DBN which resembles EM disorders resulting from lesions of the cerebellar flocculus in animal experiments therefore paramedian tract cells are assumed to fulfill an important CF in ocular movement control such as gazeholding and maintaining vestibular balance this paper presents a yearold female who manifested DBN due to damage to the paramedian tract cells caused by a localized ICM lesion in the medulla oblongata we found that a paramedian medullary lesioninduced nystagmus similar to that observed following floccular lesions clearly indicates that a subgroup of paramedian tract cells projecting to the flocculus was impaired this finding has important implications in considering a brainstemcerebellar FB loop involved in vestibulooculomotor controls such as vestibular balance although there have been a few reports of downbeat nystagmus caused by lesions in the midline region of the lower brainstem to our knowledge none report the occurrence of nystagmus due to a strictly localized medullar lesion such as the one described here
PG,pyrolytic graphite,TS-4061,highly oriented PG hopg implanted with n ar and b is studied as a support for platinum nanoparticle catalysts for fuel cells experimentally we find that pt supported by nhopg is more disperse more catalytically AS and suffers less particle ripening than native hopg while pt supported on arirradiated hopg is slightly more AS but ripens more than pt on native hopg defective hopg supports are modeled by density functional theory dft calculations that confirm and explain the above exp results first defect energetics are studied to demonstrate that nitrogen doping at high doses likely causes agglomerated nitrogenous defect clusters and irradiation with ar ions creates vacancies that agglomerate in vacancy clusters second pt catalyst particle nucleation and agglomeration is studied for pt clusters supported on hopg with nitrogen defects calculations show a greater driving force for nucleation and greater particle tethering for pt clusters supported on hopg with vacancy aggregations this T0 shows a strong driving force for nucleation and a much enhanced tendency for particle ripening third the electronic structure of pt clusters on different supports is calculated finally reaction energetics are calculated for two likely reaction pathways over pt clusters supported on different hopg substrates ptnhopg shows modified electronic structure of the pt catalyst and increased activity towards oxygen ptarhopg shows slightly enhanced catalytic activity towards oxygen in all respects the findings agree with experiment the calculations attribute the catalytic activity changes primarily to changes in the workfunction and secondarily to the dband structure of supported pt particles

CM,clinical mastitis,TS-4063,NK antibodies nab are defined as antibodies that circulate in normal HI under the absence of deliberate antigenic stimulation two types of nab are distinguished nab towards exogenous antigens and nab towards autoantigens naab the objectives of the current T0 were threefold first we studied the relation between metabolic health and concentrations of nab binding KLH klh or lipopolysaccharide lps in milk and plasma of dairy cows in early lactation second we determined the presence of naab IB transferrin S1 and thyroglobulin in bovine milk third we studied the relation between naab in bovine milk and mammary health for the first objective dairy cows were either fed a control c n or a diet where kg of concentrates were replaced by an isoenergetic concentrate containing marine algae alg from week till postpartum experiment plasma and milk samples were analyzed weekly for nab binding either klh or lps plasma was analyzed for glucose nonesterified fatty acids nefa and Î²hydroxybutyrate bhba for the second and third objective milk samples were collected weekly from dairy cows from week till postpartum and analyzed for milk composition and naab IB myosin transferrin and thyroglobulin experiment for both datasets naab titers are expressed as log values of the highest dilution giving a positive reaction data are expressed as means Â± sem repeated observations were analyzed in a mixed model in experiment no diet effect p was observed on nab binding lps in plasma or milk nab binding klh in milk was greater p for cows fed the control diet concentration of nab binding klh and lps in plasma was negatively related to plasma nefa concentration p in experiment nab binding myosin Â± thyroglobulin Â± and transferrin Â± were identified in milk CM incidence tended to be positively related to concentration of nab binding S1 p and negatively related to nab IB transferrin p in conclusion nab IB klh and lps in plasma and milk are related to metabolic health as indicated by plasma nefa concentration furthermore this T0 demonstrates the presence of naab in bovine milk and shows trends for a relation between naab IB autoantigens and mastitis future studies should confirm these trends and shed light on the predictive value of naab in bovine milk for mammary health
PCC,peripheral cholangiocarcinoma,TS-4064,to evaluate the clinical utility of computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri in the diagnosis of PCC of the liver patients with pathologically proven IP cholangiocarcinoma were examined with both ct and mri on ct scans in cases the tumors appeared as irregular lowattenuation masses with a wide variation in heterogeneity contrast enhancement of the tumors was mild in nine cases and moderate in one case at the periphery tumor was not identified in one case on tweighted mris the PT showed low intensity in eight cases and isointensity in three cases on tweighted images the PT showed high intensity in all cases focal dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts around the tumor was seen in one case on mris and in four cases on ct scans portal vein invasion of the PT was seen in one case and lymphadenopathy was seen in four cases on both mris and ct scans mri was slightly superior to ct in detecting the tumors was VPI to ct in delineating focal ductal dilatation around the tumors and was equal to ct in assessing extent of the tumors
HM,malignancies,TS-4065,for patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung CA nsclc undergoing surgery both induction and adjuvant chemotherapy improve survival and curability induction chemotherapy is also feasible for patients with early stage nsclc randomized trials of induction treatment for early stage nsclc as well as induction and adjuvant treatment for stage iiia patients are in progress these trials should build on current successes and add new approaches such as targeted therapies and vaccines in an attempt to prevent metastases recurrence and second primary HM
PL,pancreatic lipase,TS-4066,human gastric lipase hgl activity on TB w/o/w was detected only in the presence of amphiphiles such as bile salts proteins serum Al betalactoglobulin or ovalbumin or phosphatidylcholine these findings are contrary to the strong GABA effect of amphiphiles observed on pure pancreatic lipase to reveal hgl activity amphiphiles should be added prior to hgl this may prevent irreversible interfacial denaturation hgl activity was found to be restricted to a triacylglycerolwater surface tension ranging from dyncm to dyncm all amphiphiles which decrease the interfacial tension below dyncm act as irreversible inhibitors of hgl in the absence and in the presence of bile salts our results confirm that hgl is capable of hydrolysing triacylglycerol in the presence of the physiological concentration of bile salts prevailing in the upper small intestine and in the presence of alimentary proteins these observations could explain the high dietary lipid absorption observed under PL deficiency
IM,inner medulla,TS-4067,due to ureas role in producing concentrated urine its transport is critically important to the conservation of body water within the renal inner medulla urea is transported by both facilitated and AS urea transport mechanisms the vasopressinregulated facilitated urea transporter uta in the terminal IM collecting duct imcd permits high rates of transepithelial urea transport and results in delivery of large quantities of urea into the deepest portions of the IM where it is needed to maintain a high interstitial osmolality for maximal urine concentration four cdna isoforms of the uta urea transporter family have been cloned in addition there are three secondary AS sodiumdependent urea transport mechanisms in imcd subsegments active urea secretion in the apical membrane of the terminal imcd from untreated rats active urea absorption in the apical membrane of the initial imcd from lowprotein fed or hypercalcemic rats and AS urea absorption in the basolateral membrane of the initial imcd from furosemidetreated rats this review will focus on integrative studies of the rapid and longterm regulation of urea transporters in rats with reduced urine concentrating ability these studies led to the surprising result that the basalfacilitated urea permeability in the terminal imcd and uta protein abundance are increased during in vivo conditions associated with an impaired urine concentrating ability in contrast there are two response patterns of active urea transporters hypercalcemia a lowprotein diet and furosemide result in induction of AS urea absorption in the initial imcd albeit by different mechanisms and inhibition of AS urea secretion in the terminal imcd while water diuresis results in upregulation of AS urea secretion in the terminal imcd without any active urea absorption in the initial imcd the first pattern contributes to the urine concentrating defect by increasing urea delivery to the base of the inner medulla thus decreasing urea delivery distally to the inner medullary tip the second response pattern will directly decrease urea content in the deep inner medulla uta urea transporters are also expressed outside the kidney recent studies show that the liver has phloretininhibitable urea transport and that it occurs via a kda uta protein when rats are made uremic the abundance of this kda uta protein increases in the liver in vivo this upregulation of the kda uta protein may allow HCs to increase ureagenesis to reduce the accumulation of ammonium andor bicarbonate in uremia
BO,bronchiolitis obliterans,TS-4068,BO defined histologically or clinically is the most significant longterm cause of morbidity and mortality LT it shares many pathogenetic features with chronic allograft dysfunction that can occur in bone marrow liver heart and kidney recipients lessons learned in the prevention and management of this disorder in lung recipients therefore should have application to the analogous process that develops in other organ allograft recipients because the lung is exposed to the external environment it can be sampled repeatedly by techniques like BAL lavage and transbronchial lung biopsy with little or no longterm adverse consequence to the allograft excellent pulmonary CF tests also are available with which to assess the functional capacity of the allograft and to correlate with the results from immunologic testing for these reasons this disorder in lung recipients could serve as a model to determine the pathogenesis and treatment of the analogous disorder that may develop in other major organ recipients because this disorder most likely is immunologic in origin advances in transplant immunology that create tolerance between the donor and recipient as well as efforts to prevent cmv infection and airway ICM injury likely will be effective preventive measures although augmented immunosuppression appears to be of some benefit in treating bronchiolitis obliterans it is far from optimal and new or better use of current IS medications is warranted because the number of recipients at any one center is too few to critically assess the efficacy and safety of different IS regimens it is likely that collaboration between SPK centers will be necessary for success to be achieved
HF,hemorrhagic fever,TS-4069,crimeancongo HF cchf an acute viral infection is a zoonotic disease which is transmitted to humans by infected ticks direct contact with fresh meat or blood of INF animals usually domestic livestock or direct contact with the blood or secretions of an INF person livestock handlers skin processors veterinary staff livestock market workers and other personnel engaged in jobs requiring some contact with animals andor animal products are at high risk for cchf most reported cases of this disease in iran belong to butchers and slaughterhouse workers
CC,collagenous colitis,TS-4070,we have seen two patients with watery diarrhea whose workup revealed a collagenous infiltration beneath the rectal epithelium within a year PS disappeared in both repeated rectal biopsy revealed the disappearance of the collagen layer CC may thus present as a transient condition
CSP,cavum septi pellucidi,TS-4071,morphological as well as physiological findings reported here point to the existence of a previously undescribed brain organ we refer to as the organum cavum prelamina terminalis ocplt the organ is a hollow sagittal forebrain structure consisting of a vertical interhemispheric horn that overlies the anterior aspect of the lamina terminalis and a horizontal horn that lies in the SP below the CC this horizontal horn was previously referred to as the CSP a vestigial anatomic curiosity the narrow cavities of the horizontal and vertical horns join under the genu of the corpus callosum and communicate freely the two horns do not communicate with the cerebral ventricular system or the subarachnoid spaces microinjections of greater than or equal to ng angiotensin ii into all regions of the cavity resulted in significant drinking whereas injections into areas surrounding the cavities were ineffective these data show that the organ is a discrete brain entity and displays high sensitivity to angiotensin ii these findings suggest that the ocplt is another BB organ with significant effects on fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and perhaps other BB functions
SE,extraction,TS-4072,two extraction and liquid chromatographic procedures are presented which separate amprolium from EDC in poultry feed or premixes that could interfere with its fluorometric determination the procedures are based on earlier work on the determination of B1 in food samples amprolium is extracted from feed with a hexaneaqueous SSA mix separated on a c column and detected fluorometrically T3 postcolumn derivatization for premixes water SE is used values for the amprolium content of poultry feed obtained with these procedures are in good agreement with those obtained with aoac official methods it is suggested that these methods with suitable modifications may be of use for routine analysis of amprolium in feeds the overall methods are rapid and appear to give reasonable results
CP,classical,TS-4073,ex vivo GT approaches hold great promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases where there is currently no cure or adequate treatment for affected individuals in this review we have focused on the use of ex vivo gene transfer techniques in FPD models however the issues and approaches outlined are applicable to other neurodegenerative disorders in utilizing the ex vivo strategy two considerations are critical for delivery of therapeutic C2 of Tg product to the target i the vector system and ii the cell type for grafting we describe herein different vector systems that are currently available and briefly review the various cell types that have been transduced and grafted into the striatum of animals with exp FPD the strategies for application of gene therapy techniques to a treatment for parkinsons disease have expanded beyond the CP dopamine replacement toward the use of neurotrophic AF in enhancing cell function or preventing cell death in addition we explore the utility of cnsderived neural progenitors as alternative cell types for ex vivo GT in an animal model of FPD
LD,laterodorsal,TS-4074,the neuronal structures with somatostatinlike immunoreactivity have been studied in the BB of the urodele amphibian pleurodeles waltl intense immunoreactivity was observed in neurons and fibers distributed throughout the brain within the telencephalon the subpallial regions were densely labeled containing both cells and SF primarily in the striatum and amygdala the majority of the somatostatin immunoreactive SN were located in the POA area and hypothalamus although less numerous cells were also found in the TH a conspicuous innervation of the ME was revealed which arises from the Thy cell populations in the BS intense fiber labeling was present in the tectum and tegmentum whereas cell bodies were located only in the tegmentum of the mesencephalon and in the interpeduncular raphe and Rt nuclei of the rhombencephalon longitudinal fiber tracts throughout the BS were observed and they continued into the spinal cord in the LD funiculus the localization of somatostatin in CA and nitrergic neurons was studied by double labeling techniques with antisera against tyrosine hydroxylase and nitric oxide synthase CAs and somatostatin only colocalized in a cell population in the VP POA area in turn the striatum and amygdala contained SN with somatostatin and nitric oxide synthase our results demonstrated that the somatostatin neuronal system in the brain of pleurodeles waltl is consistent with that observed in anuran amphibians and shares many characteristics with those of amniotes colocalization of somatostatin with catecholamines and nitric oxide is very restricted in the urodele BB but in places that can be easily compared to those reported for mammals suggesting that interactions between these neurotransmitter systems are a primitive feature shared by tetrapod vertebrates
SC,supercoiled,TS-4075,we examined structural properties of poly dcadtg the telomeric dna CS of the ciliated protozoan tetrahymena under conditions of high negative supercoiling poly dcadtg inserted in a circular plasmid vector was preferentially sensitive to digestion with s nuclease only the ca strand was sensitive to firststrand s cutting with a markedly skewed pattern of hypersensitive sites in tracts of either or TRs linear poly dcatg showed no preferential s sensitivity no circular dichroism spectra indicative of a zdna conformation no unusual tm and no unusual migration in PAGE the s nuclease sensitivity properties are consistent with a model proposed previously for SC poly dctdag pulleyblank et al cell consisting of a dsDNA protonated RH underwound helix we propose that this structure is shared by related telomeric sequences and may play a role in their biological recognition
SD,sexual dysfunction,TS-4076,although health surveys on sexual issues during incarceration have shown that women report having engaged in sexual activities while in prison studies on sexual functioning in female inmates have been largely dismissed this study aimed to assess sexual functioning among incarcerated women and determine the psychometric and sociodemographic features that are possibly related to the risk of SD this was a crosssectional study conducted inside a penitentiary for women in sÃ£o paulo brazil from june to june inmates convicted of robbery or homicide were recruited high risk of female SD hrfsd was measured using the female SF index and participants were also evaluated for alcohol and drug misuse impulsiveness depressive PS and psychosocial features descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were utilized to analyze the data among the participants met the criteria for hrfsd older age total time of imprisonment and depressive symptoms were related to a higher risk while the status of being married being black having sexual relations with other inmates and receiving conjugal visits were associated with a lower risk as only inmates admitted to having sexual relationships inside prison we evaluated this subsample separately for this subsample women met the criteria for hrfsd and the main AF associated with this risk were total time of imprisonment and depressive symptoms incarcerated women are uniquely vulnerable because they often have histories of ED and violence stemming from multiple sources and experience considerable psychological symptoms as a consequence of imprisonment with the affected population rarely receiving psychosocial management for sexual dysfunction service delivery efforts should be intensified to target this highrisk population
RRC,residency review committee,TS-4077,current problems leading to excessive stress in residency are presented and are compared with those of a generation ago solutions are proposed that can be summarized as follows commitment by the program director and chairman to resolving stress in residency and flexibility by the american board of obstetrics and gynecology and the RRC a general discussion is presented
CE,clinical examination,TS-4078,the proclamation of april of a MOH labor and welfare ordinance has enabled doctors to prescribe drugs for an outpatient without a limit on the length of prescription terms except for a few drugs there is a concern that the prescriptionterm deregulation could cause careless drug therapy management in order to extend the interval between patient hospital visits the purpose of this study is to make pre and postderegulation comparisons of two items prescription terms and implementation of CE that complied with packageinsert precautions and to discuss the approaches to increase safety prescription terms have lengthened progressively in the preregulation period of january to march the mean prescription term was days in the postregulation period of july to september it was days and in july to september days even for antitumor agents there were prescriptions over days T3 deregulation there was no significant difference between the pre and postderegulation compliance ratios for the packageinsert precautions in eight drugs of investigated nine however one case had a delay in PCD of liver dysfunction which was caused by deviation from the onceamonth testing indicated in the packageinsert precautions for prolonged prescription terms the evidence suggested that the deregulation led to negligent drug therapy management to assure safe therapy the following should be addressed first sufficient CF of a computerized prescriber order entry system and second creation of a new framework with pharmacists AS involvement such as collaborative therapy management with physicians
CR,complete remission rate,TS-4079,we reviewed cases of waldeyers ring lymphomas stage ie iie had highgrade histology according to kiels classification fourteen patients received radiotherapy CT and chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy in CR was and relapse rate at years overall diseaserelated survival drs and EFS efs were and respectively combined treatment provided both significantly better drs vs and efs vs than RT most of the patients with highgrade histology received the combined treatment and this subgroup achieved a LT efs of both drs and efs were also significantly longer in patients under at MVA favorable prognostic AF were lower age for drs and combined treatment for efs
CST,skills training,TS-4080,traditional training of electroconvulsive therapy ect consists of a combination of didactic and handson demonstrations using ect equipment our goal was to explore the potential of a highfidelity patient simulator hps to train these skills to our knowledge this is the first time an hps has been used for CST in psychiatry
HR,hybrid resistance,TS-4081,B/W mice vigorously reject transplanted parental bone marrow bm cells which is a phenomenon called HR hr since nk cells play crucial role in hr both nkcd nkt cells and nkcd nk cells have been possible candidates of effector cells to elucidate the major effector cells in hr we employed rag mice devoid of t b and nkt cells and cytokine receptor common gamma S1 and rag doubledeficient gammacyrag mice lacking all lymphoid cells including nk cells rag f hybrid mice rejected parental bm cells to the extent similar to wildtype wt f hybrids in contrast male gammacyrag f hybrid mice were unable to reject parental bm cells T3 reconstitution with nk but not nkt cells male gammacyrag f hybrid mice restored the ability to reject parental bm cells collectively it is concluded that nkt cells play little role if any and nk cells are the only cells involved in hr
CT,computed tomographic scanning,TS-4082,advancements in imaging pose new diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas as smaller lesions in the relatively inaccessible regions of the petrous apex and clivus are identified differentiation of true pathology from artifact and anatomic variants is critical in management of these lesions we describe our experience with five patients diagnosed with petrous apex lesions three cholesteatomas one cholesterol granuloma and one falsepositive softtissue obliteration of the temporal bone defect with postoperative followup using highresolution CT and magnetic resonance imaging is proposed as an alternative to exteriorization
AC,acebutolol,TS-4083,the present study was performed to assess the relationship between the hydrophobicity of drugs and GABA strength pa on chronotropic or inotropic actions displacemental potencies of hcgp or iiodocyanopindolol IB to betaadrenoceptors betaars pki or dissociating potencies of these drugs from betaars of atria strips pretreated with drugs the betablockers used in the present T0 were bopindolol AS metabolite of bopindolol atenolol propranolol pindolol nadolol alprenolol oxprenolol metoprolol labetalol and AC the value of the partition coefficient of propranolol was the highest and that of the betaselective blocker atenolol was the lowest although low correlation coefficients between hydrophobicity and GABA betablocking potencies determined by pharmacological experiments or displacemental potencies by the radioligand binding assay using hcgp and iiodocyanopindolol were observed significant relationships between hydrophobicities of these drugs and dissociating potencies from betaars were observed these results suggest that the hydrophobicity of drugs may be important for the slow dissociation from betaars but not for the betablocking action
ET,essential tremor,TS-4084,it is wellestablished that during goaldirected motor tasks patients with ET have increased oscillations in the and hz bands it remains unclear if these increased oscillations relate to activity in TPS brain regions this T0 used taskbased functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the BB activity associated with oscillations in grip force SO between patients with ET patients with parkinsons disease who had clinically evident tremor and HCs the findings demonstrate that patients with essential tremor have increased BB activity in the motor SC and supplementary motor area compared with controls and this activity correlated positively with hz force oscillations BB activity in cerebellar lobules iv was reduced in ET compared with controls and correlated negatively with hz force oscillations widespread differences in BB activity were observed between essential tremor and FPD using PET connectivity analyses during the task evidenced reduced cerebellarcortical functional connectivity in patients with ET compared with controls and FPD this study provides new evidence that in essential tremor hz force oscillations relate to hyperactivity in motor cortex hz force oscillations relate to the hypoactivity in the cerebellum and cerebellarcortical PET connectivity is impaired
NC,neck circumference,TS-4085,hypoxemia secondary to SA is commonly seen in patients with acromegaly and this alteration apparently leads to considerable morbidity and mortality among such patients with the objective of identifying hypoxemia based on clinical data we conducted a crosssectional study of patients with acromegaly all of whom were submitted to nocturnal oximetry and DUE of snoring as well as to the determination of body mass index bmi and NC in addition daytime sleepiness was evaluated using the ESS ess in this T0 sleep hypoxemia was defined as five or more episodes of desaturation per hour the sensitivity and specificity of the various parameters in predicting such hypoxemia were respectively as follows snoring and bmi kgm and NC cm and ess score and for patients with a neck circumference of more than cm the probability of sleep hypoxemia was found to increase from pretest to posttest for patients with a neck circumference of less than cm positivity for two or three of the other parameters snoring ess score and bmi kgm increased the posttest probability to whereas positivity for only one or none reduced posttest probability to we can conclude that the clinical parameters evaluated allowed us to predict with considerable accuracy whether or not sleep hypoxemia would occur in patients with acromegaly
PCA,portacaval anastomosis,TS-4086,treatment of portal hypertension by portal decompressive surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt tips results in new or worsening episodes of portalsystemic encephalopathy particularly in older patients as part of a series of studies to elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the agerelated increased portalsystemic HIVE following shunt surgery local cerebral gl utilization a measure of regional brain PET activity was assessed using the cdeoxyglucose autoradiographic technique in monthold young AD and monthold old adult rats following endtoside portacaval anastomosis CBF glucose utilization was decreased by p in FC cortex of monthold rats following portacaval anastomosis more widespread alterations of gl utilization involving FC and frontoparietal cortices as well as thalamic structures were observed in the brains of monthold rats following portacaval anastomosis despite blood ammonia concentrations of a comparable magnitude decreased CBF glucose utilization in FC and frontoparietal cortex of old AD rats following PCA probably results from decreased cerebral energy requirements as a consequence of neurotransmitterrelated dysfunction the greater susceptibility of aging BB to the deleterious effects of PCA is consistent with the higher incidence of encephalopathy in older cirrhotic patients following portacaval anastomosis or tips
TS,test stimulus,TS-4087,in experiments to investigate the duration of the time for which cortical SN respond when the ID of a visual stimulus is just possible we presented a test face stimulus for ms and followed it at different intervals by a masking stimulus either an no pattern or a face while recording from single SN in the temporal visual cortex of macaques when there was no mask the cells responded to the ms of the test stimulus for ms far longer than the presentation time we suggest that this reflects the operation of a shortterm memory system implemented in cortical circuitry if the mask was a stimulus which did not stimulate the cells either a nonface DP or a face which was a noneffective CS- for that cell then as the interval between the ON of the TS and the ON of the mask stimulus the SOA was reduced the length of time for which the cells fired in response to the test stimulus was reduced it is suggested that this is due to the mask stimulating adjacent cells in the cortex which by lateral inhibition reduce the responses of the cells G1 by the TS when the SOA was ms faceselective SN in the IT of macaques responded for a period of ms before their firing was interrupted by the mask with the same testmask SOA of ms humans could just identify which of six faces was shownabstract truncated at words
HS,highsalt diet,TS-4088,cyclooxygenase cox is involved in kidney morphogenesis and is transiently elevated in the immature kidney in AD rats renal cortical cox expression is tonically suppressed by mineralocorticoids mc and glucocorticoids gc and induced by chronic salt restriction young rats have low levels of gc and are in a state of relative volume SD the present T0 was designed to investigate the mechanisms underlying elevated cortical cox expression in the immature kidney supplementation of gc or mc suppressed cortical cox expression in suckling rats gc suppression was significantly but not CR prevented by either an mc receptor antagonist or a gc receptor antagonist mc suppression was completely prevented by a MRs receptor antagonist salt supplementation suppressed cortical cox expression in a dose and timedependent pattern in the suckling rats cortical cox expression in the weanling rats was upregulated by a lowsalt diet and downregulated by a HS these results suggest that relative volume SD and reduced gc levels are involved in elevated cortical cox expression in the immature rodent kidney
LM,longitudinal muscle,TS-4089,a population of multipotent stem cells capable of differentiating into SN and glia has been isolated from adult intestine in humans and rodents while these cells may provide a pool of stem cells for neurogenesis in the ENS ens such a CF has been difficult to demonstrate in vivo an extensive T0 by joseph et al involving rats and mice submitted to various insults demonstrated neuronal uptake of thymidine analog brdu in only rat here we introduce a novel approach to T0 neurogenesis in the ens using an ex vivo organotypic tissue culturing system culturing LM and myenteric plexus tissue we show that the ENS has tremendous replicative capacity with the majority of neural crest cells demonstrating edu uptake by hours edu cells express both neuronal and glial markers proliferation appears dependent on the ptenpikakt pathway with decreased pten mrna expression and increased pten phosphorylation inactivation corresponding to increased akt activity and proliferation inhibition of pten with bpvphen augments proliferation while ly a pik inhibitor blocks it these data suggest that the ens is capable of neurogenesis in a pten dependent manner
TA,telomerase activity,TS-4090,UC bloodderived mesenchymal stem cells are a promising source of cells for regeneration therapy due to their multipotency high proliferative capacity relatively noninvasive collection and ready availability however extended CC inevitably triggers cellular senescencethe irreversible arrest of cell divisionthereby limiting the proliferative lifespan of adult stem cells wntÎ²catenin signaling plays a PET role as a key regulator of selfrenewal and differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells mscs and thus wntÎ²catenin signaling and cellular senescence might be closely connected here we show that the expression C2 of canonical wnt families decrease as mscs age during subculture activation of the wnt pathway by treatment with wntaconditioned medium or GS kinase Î² inhibitors such as sb and bromoindirubinoxime delays the progression of cellular senescence as shown by the decrease in the senescence effectors p and prb lowered senescenceassociated Î²galactosidase activity and increased TA in contrast suppression of the wnt pathway by treatment with dickkopf an antagonist of the wnt coreceptor and Î²catenin sirna transfection promotes senescence in mscs interestingly the magnitude of the response to enhanced wntaÎ²catenin signaling appears to depend on the senescent state during extended culture particularly T3 multiple passages these results suggest that wnta signaling might be a predominant factor that could be used to overcome senescence in longterm cultured mscs by directly intervening in the proliferative capacity and msc senescence the PET role of wntaÎ²catenin signaling in hedging cellular senescence may allow the OD of new approaches for stem cellbased therapies
CS,conscious sedation,TS-4091,as indications for tavr continue to grow experienced centers strive to adopt further minimally invasive techniques and continue to improve outcomes metaanalysis of the available data demonstrate that conscious sedation is associated with decreased icu and hospitalization time and is not associated with decreased procedural tau or safety randomized controlled clinical trial data will be needed to confirm observational findings suggesting decreased mortality with CS versus GA anesthesia
CT,alone,TS-4092,colorectal CA is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world threatening human health the treatment strategy of stage ii and stage iii colorectal cancer has changed from surgery CT to multidisciplinary mode emphasizing perioperative treatment the indication of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage ii CC is still defined by highrisk factors but only microsatellite status and
MS,mean sensitivity,TS-4093,the presence or absence of fetal PLB movements may be helpful in differentiating between true and false preterm labor we attempted to demonstrate the clinical utility of this simple US observation in predicting ST delivery outcome during suspected PT labor a total of pregnancies between and weeks gestation with presumed preterm labor were observed in a prospective manner during T2 of observation with RT ultrasound at the time of admission fetal breathing movements were observed in patients and considered absent in the remaining patients in those pregnancies with absent FB movements true labor with subsequent delivery occurred in patients of the pregnancies with fetal PLB movements present continued for greater than hours it appears that the absence of fetal PLB movement is a reliable indicator of imminent preterm delivery irrespective of fetal membrane status p less than the observed MS and specificity of this phenomenon in predicting ST delivery outcome are mean sd and respectively a multivariant statistical model based on the FC WG blood cell counts initial cervical examination results and premature rupture of membranes could successfully predict delivery outcome in to of cases the addition of FB movement analysis to the MM allowed for the correct prediction of outcome in of the cases
BL,blood lymphocytes,TS-4094,the effect of granulomatous infections upon the activity of a t lymphocyte subclass in human peripheral blood that can be induced by concanavalin a con a to CF in a suppressor mode was studied peripheral BL pbl from eleven patients with disseminated mycotic or mycobacterial infections or from controls were preincubated with and without con a washed and cultured with allogeneic pbl freshly drawn from healthy donors sensitive to histoplasmin dna synthesis was then measured in cocultures stimulated by con a histoplasmin or by the mixed lymphocyte culture mlc reaction CT as compared with cells preincubated without con a the con apretreated cells were significantly less effective in suppressing the responses of normal pbl to histoplasmin p and in a oneway mlc reaction p the con ainduced suppressor activity of pbl from nine patients with localized granulomatous infections did not differ significantly from that exerted by pbl of NCs in two of the three coculture systems employed these studies suggest that either dysfunction or a reduction of the con ainducible tsuppressor cell subpopulation in peripheral blood is frequent among patients was disseminated granulomatous infections
SI,substantia innominata,TS-4095,the ACh innervation of the interpeduncular nucleus was investigated by use of FL tracer histology in combination with ChAT chat immunohistochemistry and acetylcholinesterase ache pharmacohistochemistry following PI or EB infusion into the interpeduncular nucleus brains were processed for colocalization of transported FL label and chat and ache control infusions of tracers were made into the VP tegmental area in order to delimit the course of putative ACh afferents to the interpeduncular nucleus from extrahabenular sources knife cuts surrounding the habenular nuclei were performed somata containing PI that were highly immunoreactive for chat were found primarily in the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band the MC preoptic area and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus also referred to as the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus a few such colabeled somata were also detected in the medial septal nucleus SI nucleus basalis and PPT nucleus a good rho was observed between intenselystaining achecontaining and chatpositive neurons projecting to the interpeduncular nucleus from the aforementioned structures although the medial habenula contained numerous cells demonstrating transported label following interpeduncular infusion of fluorescent tracers the chatpositivity associated with somata in that nucleus was weak compared to chatlike immunoreactivity in known cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brainstem knife cuts that separated the habenular nuclei from the stria medullaris and neural regions lateral and posterior to those nuclei while leaving the fasciculus retroflexus intact resulted in a reduction of chatlike immunoreactivity in the medial habenular nucleus fasciculus retroflexus and interpeduncular nucleus these data suggest that the ACh innervation of the interpeduncular nucleus derives primarily from chatpositive cells in the basal forebrain and dorsolateral tegmental nucleus and that putative cholinergic fibers having their origin in the medial habenula if they exist constitute a minor portion of the ACh input to the interpeduncular nucleus
MAT,mean absorption time,TS-4096,based on the concept of physiological pharmacokinetics the hepatic FP metabolism and plasma levels following intravenous and p.o. of barbiturates in the rb was predicted based on the relationships between principle kinetic parameters and lipophilicity chloroformwater partition coefficient good loglog linear relationships between kinetic parameters and lipophilicity were obtained for the seven barbiturates examined the values of correlation coefficient were improved slightly by using the QTc values for partition coefficients of nonionic molecules in the cases of principle parameters such as drugprotein and drugblood cell affinity intrinsic hepatic clearance and unbound volume of distribution there was also a good linear relationship between Ka constant mean absorption time and lipophilicity the mean hepatic transit time was negligible for the most lipophilic drug hexobarbital examined this suggests that the MAT for these barbiturates does reflect the absorption process the available fraction in relation to hepatic FP metabolism was well predicted from the lipophilicity by both wellstirred and paralleltube models and the difference in the values predicted by both models was minimal there were good relationships between predicted and observed values for plasma levels T3 intravenous and p.o. except for two cyclobarbital and phenobarbital of the seven drugs used the great difference between predicted and observed values for these two drugs was considered due to substituent effects in CL metabolism
SSA,singlestrand annealing,TS-4097,the rnaguided endonuclease clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprassociated protein cas derived from crispr systems is a simple and efficient genomeediting technology applied to various cell types and organisms so far the extensive RPA to detect the cleavage activity of customized casguide rna grna is t endonuclease i tei assay which is time and labor consuming in this study we developed a visualized fluorescent reporter system to detect the specificity and cleavage activity of grna two grnas were designed to target porcine immunoglobulin m and nephrosis genes the cleavage activity was measured by using the traditional HDR hdrbased FL reporter and the SSA ssabased fluorescent reporter we established in this study compared with the hdr assay the ssabased FL reporter approach was a more efficient and dependable strategy for testing the cleavage activity of casgrna thereby providing a universal and efficient RPA for the application of crisprcas in generating genemodified cells and organisms

IT,information technology,TS-4100,in this case report difficulties in cancer pain therapy are highlighted which can make adequate pain relief difficult in addition to compliance the main factor in this case report related to the patient organizational setting and technological developments in recent years have become increasingly important the transfer in storing medical records from paper version to a digital file has already started and due to increasing amounts of data is also without alternative though there is a lack of compatibility of the available IT it systems in austria as well as across the borders in europe this often impedes continuous care to cancer patients because this patient population is often treated by physicians in different settings and various disciplines in particular changes in the analgesic regimen to optimize pain relief in an inpatient setting sometimes cause problems when the medicines have to be prescribed subsequently in a private practicebased on the available literature the need for electric data collection in the health system and close networking with GA practitioners and other physicians working in private practice will be discussed especially with regards to the medication this is not only sensible and necessary in order to increase transparency and traceability of medical prescriptions but also to minimize medical PE and avert harm to the patient
RP,radiation pneumonitis,TS-4101,we critically examined conventional techniques for studying static mechanical properties of the lungs using NM mice exposed to high o concentrations and mice with radiation pneumonitis and radiation fibrosis successive pressurevolume pv curves were performed in situ both before and after degassing the lungs in vacuo in both hyperoxia and RP the deflation limbs of the curves were shifted to the right compared with their corresponding controls however the curves were further shifted rightward and downward after degassing the lung as compared with the curve obtained before degassing this effect of degassing was most marked in abnormal lungs and was not QTc by repeating inflationdeflation cycles nor by inflating to higher pressures and allowing time for units to open histology showed that abnormal lungs fixed in inflation T3 degassing were unevenly reinflated it is speculated that in conditions such as hyperoxia and radiation pneumonitis altered surface tension properties may result in uneven reinflation of the lungs T3 degassing and that nonuniform reinflation may produce spurious shifts in the shape as well as the amplitude of pv curves thus pv curves performed with air T3 degassing the lung may not correctly represent the mechanical properties of abnormal lungs
SI,selfincompatible,TS-4102,the magnitude of inbreeding depression in invading plant populations is often presumed to be small and of little consequence the purpose of this T0 was to assess the magnitude of inbreeding depression in a pollenlimited partially SI invading plant population the magnitude and timing of inbreeding depression were compared among ten maternal plants sampled from a population of smooth cordgrass spartina alterniflora invading san francisco bay selfed and outcrossed progeny were compared for embryo abortion survival of seedlings and growthsurvival at the end of the first growing season in three greenhouse environments estimates of inbreeding depression varied among environments with competitive environment highnutrient environment lownutrient environment populationlevel estimates of inbreeding depression ranged from to however maternal plants varied significantly in their magnitude of inbreeding depression ranging from to the confidence interval for inbreeding depression for some maternal plants included zero there was a significant negative correlation between the overall magnitude of inbreeding depression and selffertility rate among maternal plants the few maternal plants with high selffertility carried relatively little genetic load and their selfed progeny are likely to survive on open mudflats the MK-801 pollenlimited growing conditions associated with invasion may allow selffertility to spread in this population
TL,thermoluminescent,TS-4103,ionization chamber and TL dosimeter measurements were made to verify the dosimetry data provided to the radiation therapy chart review office of interinstitutional electron intraoperative radiotherapy clinical trials the ionization measurements included intraoperative radiotherapy applicator output and depth dose measurements made at the stated and depths at different radiotherapy facilities mailable thermoluminescent dosimeter measurements including output and depth dose measurements were made at institutions the mailable TL dosimeter results show similar interinstitutional agreement both for SO and depth dose comparison with the corresponding ion chamber results for intraoperative radiotherapy applicators these results are compared to similar measurements made for conventional electron applicators
CA,cerebellar atrophy,TS-4104,ct scans of patients with seizures and patients with headaches were studied using accepted ct criteria for the diagnosis of CA the films were analyzed in a blind unbiased fashion to evaluate possible relationship between CA and phenytoin use or epilepsy itself we found no evidence that either phenytoin or epilepsy caused CA
ST,selftranscendence,TS-4105,components of the brain reward system ie the mesolimbic dopamine LD ACh and ghrelin signaling systems have been implicated in alcohol reward in preclinical studies genetic variants of these systems have previously been linked to alcohol dependence here we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms snps snp in the dopamine dâ\x82\x82 receptor drd gene snps in different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit chrn genes and snps in the genes encoding proghrelin ghrl and its receptor ghsr in a pilot study of type alcoholics n and healthy controls n these individuals were characterized using the temperament and character inventory none of the snps were associated with risk of alcohol dependence in this population the gg TT of snp rs in the chrnb was associated with increased novelty seeking while snps of the ghrelin signaling system were associated with decreased selfdirectedness aa of rs ghsr and alterations in ST aa of both rs and rs ghrl in conclusion this pilot study suggests that rewardrelated genes are associated with altered personality scores in type alcohol dependence which warrants future studies of these associations in larger study samples
DBP,demineralized bone powder,TS-4106,the results of consecutive cases of bone defects of the hand treated by curettage and implantation of demineralized bone powder compare well with a similarly matched retrospective group managed with autogenous grafts and curettage CT results revealed excellent patients or good bone healing patients in the bone powder group on independent radiographic evaluation bone bridging was noted at an average of weeks all defects healed without recurrence resorption or refracture with followup of to months in the conventionally managed retrospective group there was a failure rate necessitating reoperation DBP provides a rapid safe and effective method of management of bone defects of the hand
GF,gingival fluid,TS-4107,a watersoluble lipopolysaccharide from salmonella enteritidis and a phenolsoluble lipopolysaccharide from leptotrichia buccalis were applied topically to the healthy marginal gingivae of beagle dogs saline was applied to CL Az as an internal control increases in V1 permeability were monitored by measurement of gingival fluid and the collected GF samples were assayed for kininogenase and kinin MICs both lipopolysaccharides induced an inflammatory response as indicated by increased GF flow kininogenasekinin MICs paralleled the increases in gingival fluid flow with the highest values being associated with peak increases in GF the results indicate that both lipopolysaccharides although different in lipid solubility penetrate healthy sulcular epithelium and initiate an inflammatory response which is mediated in part by the kallikreinkinin system interrelationships between this system and other inflammatory mediators suggest that kinin generation not only plays a role in the early phases of acute gingival inflammation but may also contribute to the activation of other mediators appearing later in the response and in chronic inflammatory lesions
FS,follistatin,TS-4108,rat decidual tissue is formed by two distinct decidual cell populations located either antimesometrially or mesometrially in the uterus they differ in morphology the genes they express the proteins they secrete and the role they play during pregnancy recently we have shown that rat decidua expresses FS and AMG alpha mg two binding proteins to activin in the present T0 we determined whether the decidua of Pr and PSP rats also expresses activin whether activin messenger rna mrna is confined to a particular cell population and whether it is regulated by its IB proteins decidual and placental tissues were collected at different stages of PSP or pregnancy mrna expression was examined by in situ hybridization reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction and RNA analysis developmental studies revealed that activin a became highly expressed in the antimesometrial decidua only from day at a time when this tissue was undergoing extensive degeneration very little activin a mrna could be detected in the mesometrial decidua however late in pregnancy significant expression of activin a mrna was detected in the mesometrial decidua undergoing extensive cell death at this stage developmental T0 revealed that activin a mrna became expressed in the antimesometrial decidua only when follistatin mrna disappeared from this tissue furthermore mesometrial decidua expressing the most alpha mg mrna had reduced C2 of activin a mrna these data suggest that follistatin and alpha mg may by binding to activin prevent activin a from stimulating the expression of its own gene to examine this possibility we first established that the rat decidua expresses activin receptor ii at a constant level between days then we examined whether FS and alpha mg downregulate activin expression in a simian virus transformed decidual cell line ggad these cells express activin a mrna in abundance very little follistatin and no alpha mg FS and alpha mg caused a doserelated decrease in activin a mrna levels in these cells the same inhibitory effect was observed with activin ablocking antibody in summary the results of this investigation demonstrate that rat DT expresses mrnas for activin a and its two binding proteins FS and alpha mg the expression of each mrna is cell specific and developmentally regulated the finding that both activinbinding proteins and antibody inhibit the expression of activin a in cultured decidual cells suggests that activin regulates its own gene expression in the deciduaabstract truncated at words
PG,pancreatic glucagon,TS-4109,the effects of intraperitoneally injected pancreatic glucagon on FF and on plasma levels of pancreatic glucagon as well as on blood glucose C2 and liver glycogen content were investigated in rats in order to test the physiological relevance of exogenous glucagons satiety effect the rats were intraperitoneally injected with various doses of glucagon or microgramskg body weight bwt or vehicle when they started to eat after a hr period of FD only the highest dose of PG microgramskg bwt decreased the size and duration of the first meal T3 injection hepatic vein HPV and aortal plasma PG C2 were increased about fold by and microgramskg bwt of glucagon and about to fold by microgramskg bwt of glucagon all glucagon doses reduced CL glycogen content and increased hepatic vein blood gl levels similarly the results indicate that decreased feeding T3 intraperitoneal injection of glucagon is a pharmacological effect of the hormone at least under the conditions tested
CR,cajalretzius,TS-4110,the cellular diversity of neurons located in the MZ mz of the SC has a crucial role in cortical OD however little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in how these different neuronal cell types are specified here we show that in the mz the nuclear receptor couptfi is localized in calbindinpositive cells and not in reelinpositive cells high expression of couptfi has been detected in preplate pp and subplate sp cells suggesting that this nuclear receptor is downregulated during preplate differentiation towards the CR cr cell lineage by maintaining high ectopic expression of couptfi in preplate cells we show that couptfi represses the cr cell markers reelin and calretinin and with lower efficiency the transcription factor tbr furthermore general differentiation is not affected strongly suggesting that couptfi represses differentiation of cr cells

TD,travelers diarrhea,TS-4116,etec is an underrecognized but extremely important cause of diarrhea in the developing world where there is inadequate clean water and poor sanitation it is the most frequent bacterial cause of diarrhea in children and adults living in these areas and also the most common cause of TD etec diarrhea is most frequently seen in children suggesting that a protective immune response occurs with age the pathogenesis of etecinduced diarrhea is similar to that of cholera and includes the production of enterotoxins and CFs the clinical symptoms of etec infection can range from mild diarrhea to a severe choleralike syndrome the ERP treatment of etec diarrhea by rehydration is similar to treatment for cholera but antibiotics are not used routinely for treatment except in TD the frequency and characterization of etec on a worldwide scale are inadequate because of the difficulty in recognizing the organisms no simple diagnostic tests are presently available protection strategies as for other enteric infections include improvements in hygiene and development of ERP vaccines increases in antimicrobial resistance will dictate the drugs used for the treatment of TD efforts need to be made to improve our understanding of the worldwide importance of etec
CAD,cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase,TS-4117,the CAD cad is a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis as it catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of monolignols a cdna CS encoding the cad gene was isolated from the leaves of ginkgo biloba l designated as gbcad the FL cdna of gbcad was bp containing a bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of kda and an isoelectric point of comparative and bioinformatic analyses revealed that gbcad showed extensive homology with cads from other gymnosperm species southern blot analysis indicated that gbcad belonged to a multigene family phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that gbcad shared the same ancestor in evolution with other cads and had a further relationship with other gymnosperm species gbcad was an enzyme being phdependent and temperaturesensitive and showing a selected catalyzing tissue expression DP analysis showed that gbcad was constitutively expressed in stems and roots especially in the parts of the pest and disease infection with the lower expression being found in two to fouryearold stem further analysis showed the NC in lignin content had some linear rho with the expression level of gbcad mrna in different tissues the increased expression of gbcad was detected when the seedling were treated with exogenous abscisic acid salicylic acid ethephon ultraviolet and wounding these results indicate that the gbcad gene may play a role in the resistance mechanism to biotic and abiotic stresses as well as in tissuespecific developmental lignification
ARC,adult rat cardiomyocytes,TS-4118,ischemic preconditioning has a powerful protective potential against a reperfusioninduced injury of the postischemic myocardium CM hypercontracture ie excessive cell shortening is an essential mechanism of the reperfusioninduced injury rigor contracture ie caindependent contracture has been shown to be an import component of the reperfusioninduced hypercontracture since rigor contracture is dependent on the rapidity of the metabolic recovery during reoxygenation we hypothesized that preconditioning of the CM mitochondria may improve mitochondrial function to restore the SE balance during the initial phase of reoxygenation and may thus prevent rigor contracture for this purpose ARC were exposed to anoxia with subsequent reoxygenation for preconditioning cells were pretreated with the mitoK(ATP) KCO diazoxide i.c.v. with micromoll diazoxide significantly reduced the reoxygenationinduced hypercontracture of cardiomyocytes due to an attenuation of the caindependent rigortype contracture which was accompanied by an acceleration of the phosphocreatine resynthesis during the initial phase of reoxygenation treatment with the mitoK(ATP) channel antagonist hydroxydecanoate micromoll during preconditioning phase abolished these protective effects similarly partial suppression of the mitochondrial function with micromoll nacn during the reoxygenation phase abolished the diazoxide effects finally in isolated rat NF preconditioning with DZ prior to global ischemia significantly improved left VF and attenuated hypercontracture during reperfusion this effect could be abolished by the treatment with micromoll nacn during reperfusion taken together pharmacological preconditioning of cardiomyocytes with diazoxide protects against the reoxygenationinduced rigor hypercontracture due to an improvement of the SE recovery at the onset of reoxygenation
OP,ophenanthroline,TS-4119,induction of dna singlestrand breaks ssb their resealing and cytotoxicity by tertbutyl hydroperoxide tbuooh were investigated in cultured chinese hamster v cells the effect of the SD of cellular glutathione gsh iron chelation and induction of metallothionein mt on these parameters was studied tbuooh in a concentration range of mm induced dna ssb in a dosedependent fashion strand breakage increased as a CF of time up to h divalent iron chelator OP suppressed markedly the induction of dna ssb while the trivalent iron chelator desferrioxamine had no effect gshdepletion increased cytotoxicity of tbuooh in contrast the SD of gsh did not affect the efficiency of formation of dna ssb by tbuooh and the rate of resealing of the dna damage the induction of mt did not influence the efficiency of formation of dna ssb by tbuooh in summary while gsh depletion and mt induction affected the formation of dna ssb and cytotoxicity differently divalent iron was required for both therefore appears likely that dna breakage and cytotoxicity by tbuooh are caused by independent mechanisms

CSD was rapid td h and wide as reflected by the steadystate volume of CSD of lkg furthermore elimination was rapid with a plasma clearance of lhkg and a tel of h after repeat p.o. absorption was rapid with a halflife of h and tmax of h however BA was low the peak plasma concentration at steadystate was microgml drug accumulation was not significant T3 seven oral administrations when tau predictors were estimated ciprofloxacin showed a good profile against GNB when administered either intravenously or orally although its tau against GP microorganisms is lower
TP,tea polyphenols,TS-4153,there is considerable interest in the potential of botanicals in preventing andor alleviating chronic ailments among the most studied botanicals are compounds present in green and black teas nontoxic TP are potent antioxidants and they also modulate several signalling pathways and inhibit proteins such as mmp or protein plasminogen activator system making them very attractive potential therapeutics one criticism of the prophylactic or therapeutic use of green or black tea polyphenols was presumably the poor bioavailability of these chemicals when ingested however studies have shown that epigallocatechingallate egcg and theaflavin tf can be detected in the small and C1 intestine CL and prostate of experimental animals T3 consumption of tea extracts in particular a study was carried out on men scheduled for prostatectomy who were assigned to consume teas for five days before surgery tea polyphenols were detected in the prostate this fact contradicts the common misconception of poor bioavailability of tf and egcg and makes feasible the application of green or black TP as prophylactic and therapeutic agents theaflavins and catechins seem to act on CA cells largely through different pathways so utilisation of both could offer synergistic anticancer effects but so far no work has been done on the cumulative effects of egcg and tf on prostate cancer therefore in this T0 we have investigated if egcg in combination with tf can reduce the rate of prostate CA growth and we have observed greater cell death compared to application of either tf or egcg alone

IM,intracellular membranes,TS-4163,the rab family small g proteins are localized to distinct subsets of IM and play a key role in membrane traffic through the interaction with their TPS effector proteins rab is identified as a PI protein at tight junctions tjs and has been shown to regulate the assembly of PET tjs in epithelial cells we have demonstrated that rab mediates the endocytic recycling of integral tj protein occludin and identified a junctional rabbinding protein jrabmolecule interacting with casllike micall as a rab effector protein using a yeast twohybrid system jrabmicall has a calponinhomology domain in the nterminus a lim domain in the middle and a coiledcoil domain at the cterminus and specifically binds to the gtpbound form of rab via its cterminus it is localized to tjs in epithelial cells and distributed along AS SF in fibroblasts in epithelial cells jrabmicall as well as rab mediates the endocytic recycling of occludin but not transferrin receptor and the formation of PET tjs this chapter describes the procedures for the isolation of jrabmicall and the analysis of its functions
AC,attenuation correction,TS-4164,in earlier studiesorrection devices are not yet ready for prime time to date the literature shows as many positive results as negative results there is considerable uncertainty confusion and skepticism about the true reliability and value of currently available attenuation correction packages although commonly referred to as attenuation correction devices these packages are in fact much more complex systems and contain novel mechanical designs novel image acquisition and image reconstruction algorithms SC and depthdependent resolution compensation in addition to AC each of these variables needs to be better understood and tested prior to clinical implementation although the GA concepts are shared there are as may different approaches to AC as there are vendors in order to minimize the confusion of potential buyers about such complex systems it is desirable that before AC is implemented in routine clinical practice each AC device is rigorously tested using a standardized testing protocol potential buyers of equipment should be able to compare the results of testing with various devices against predefined criteria in order to make an educated decision such standards have as yet not been developed at the present time it is unclear whether AC of cardiac spet will remain the emperors new clothes or will develop into a fashionable armani suit until further progress has been made one cannot recommend attenuation correction devices for routine clinical practice

PLP,periodatelysineparaformaldehyde,TS-4170,renal biopsy specimens obtained from twelve patients with iga glomerulonephritis iga gn were studied by immunoelectron microscopy iem concomitantly with LM lm immunofluorescence microscopy if and electron microscopy em for iem we used horseradish peroxidase hrpconjugated antisera to human immunoglobulins ig and to the complement component c and a DWI technique with PLP plpfixed tissuechopper or cryostat sections due to wellpreserved ultrastructure and good penetration of the antisera in the tissuechopper sections a detailed analysis of the CSD of immune material in the glomeruli was possible in cryostat sections ice crystal artifacts could not be avoided the typical features of iga gn could be reliably confirmed by iem furthermore iem revealed the presence of igs and c in mesangial channels in the intracellular vacuoles of glomerular cells and in the electronlucent areas along the glomerular basement CM gbms staining of the mesangial channels indicates that they represent a route for the immune material gaining access into the mesangium intracellular vacuoles suggest that the deposited immune material can be partly eliminated through endocytosis by glomerular cells the presence of igs and c in the electronlucent areas supplies an explanation to the discrepancy sometimes observed between a positive finding in if and a lack of deposits in em
CM,center of mass,TS-4171,the aim of this investigation was to study the adaptation to an unstable support surface of kinematic synergy responsible for equilibrium control during upper trunk movements eight AD subjects were asked to bend their upper trunk forward to an angle of degrees and then to hold the final position for s first in a standard condition with two feet on the ground and the second on a rocking platform swinging in the sagittal plane the movement characteristics duration amplitude and mean angular velocity of the trunk the time course of the anteroposterior CM cm shift during the movement and the emg DP of the main muscles involved in the movement were studied under the two exp conditions kinematic synergy was quantified by performing a principal component analysis on the hip knee and ankle angle changes occurring during the movement the results indicate that the cm shift from the very ON of the movement remains controlled during performance of the forward trunk movement when the equilibrium constraints were increased the principal component analysis of the hip knee and ankle angle changes occurring during the movement showed a transition from one principal component pc in the standard condition to two components in the rocking platform condition the greatest contribution of pc weight coefficients was located at the hip level in both the standard and rocking platform conditions while the greatest contribution of pc in the rocking platform condition was located at the ankle level and the emg DP underlying kinematic synergy is modified it is concluded that a simple adaptation of kinematic synergy by changing the weight coefficients of each pair of joints participating in the movement is no longer sufficient when the equilibrium constraints increase and rather disturbs equilibrium the cns has to provide two parallel controls one to perform the trunk movement and the other to preserve equilibrium
RC,replication complex,TS-4172,achieving insulin independence is emerging as a realistic therapeutic goal in the min the late s many more rndvs have been rescued by researchers around the world regardless of methodology the main principle behind rescue of the virus has remained the same ie the formation of a PET RC by simultaneously providing the fulllength viral rna and the viral np p and l proteins however different strategies have been reported for the IS of the fulllength genome into a suitable transcription vector which remains the most challenging step of the rescue moreover several systems have been published for provision of the dnadependent rna polymerase which is needed for transcription of viral rna vrna from the transfected plasmid dna the aim of this article is to consolidate all of the current cdna assembly strategies and transcription systems used in rescue of rndv in order to attain a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each RPA

TA,thoracic aorta,TS-4190,although both epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that estrogen replacement therapy reduces the risk of coronary heart disease the mechanisms for this beneficial effect are largely unknown furthermore the addition of progestins or androgens to estrogen replacement therapy is of concern the objective of this T0 was to examine the effects of esterified estrogens alone or in combination with an androgen on arterial ldl metabolism and early atherogenesis in ovariectomized female cynomolgus monkeys arterial ldl metabolism was assessed by using duallabeled ldl that was injected hours before necropsy arterial ldl degradation was reduced by to and cholesteryl ester content was decreased by approximately in the TA in both treatment groups compared with controls in addition aortic lipid peroxidation products as assessed by thiobarbituric acid reaction were significantly lower in animals treated with esterified estrogens with a similar trend for combined estrogenandrogen treatment both treatments also reduced PC of apobcontaining lipoproteins reduced ldl particle size and increased totalbody ldl catabolism the combination of decreased arterial ldl metabolism decreased arterial lipid peroxidation and improved plasma lipoprotein metabolism may explain some of the protective effects of Es on coronary heart disease and indicate that beneficial actions extend to a combination of estrogen and androgen
CR,constant routine,TS-4191,the advanced sleep phase syndrome asps is a sleep disorder characterized by an early SO and early awakening without any disturbance of the sleep structure the management of this disease requires clinical and laboratory investigations in an attempt to confirm the phase advance of body core temperature and melatonin rhythm the use of light therapy possibly associated with chronotherapy or melatonin intake has been proposed the evolution is variable seven subjects aged to were diagnosed in our sleep disorders unit by mean of sleep log actigraphy sleep and temperature recording the sleep ON and sleep offset times were approximately the same according to sleep log actigraphy and night PSG the nadir of body core temperature was at two familial cases were identified of which was investigated in CR condition with hourly blood sampling an advanced phase of melatonin and cortisol was evidenced the disease temporarily improved in cases with light therapy and in one case with the association of CS therapy and chronotherapy these data show the difficulties of the management and the treatment of this rarely diagnosed disease
FC,free cholesterol,TS-4192,the collapse of thymic stromal cell microenvironment with age and resultant inability of the thymus to produce naive t cells contributes to lower immunesurveillance in the elderly here we show that agerelated increase in lipotoxic danger signals such as FC fc and ceramides leads to thymic ICE activation via the nlrp inflammasome elimination of nlrp and asc a critical adaptor required for inflammasome assembly reduces agerelated thymic atrophy and results in an increase in cortical TE cells t cell progenitors and maintenance of t cell repertoire diversity using a mouse model of irradiation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct we show that deletion of the nlrp inflammasome accelerates t cell reconstitution and immune REC in middleaged animals collectively these data demonstrate that lowering inflammasomedependent ICE activation increases thymic lymphopoiesis and suggest that nlrp inflammasome inhibitors maen strengthtrained women performed squats TR maximum in a motion analysis laboratory to determine hip extensor knee extensor and ankle plantar flexor net joint moment njm maximum isometric strength in relation to joint angle for these muscle groups was also determined relative muscular effect was determined as the ratio of njm to maximum voluntary torque matched for joint angle barbell load and squat depth had significant interaction effects on hip extensor knee extensor and ankle plantar flexor rme p knee extensor rme increased with greater squat depth but not barbell load whereas the opposite was found for the ankle plantar flexors both greater squat depth and barbell load increased hip extensor rme these data suggest that training for the knee extensors can be performed with low relative intensities but require a deep squat depth heavier barbell loads are required to train the hip extensors and ankle plantar flexors in designing resistance training programs with multijoint exercises how external AF influence rme of different muscle CG should be considered to meet training objectives
HS,horse serum,TS-4193,the addition of hemolytic units of GPC has been shown to enhance the neutralizing capacity of respiratory syn rs immune sera produced in guinea pigs and ferrets this same immune sera when tested without complement had little or no NT capacity the addition of complement to rs immune HS did not significantly increase its NT capacity immune HS effectively neutralized rs virus without complement other studies indicated that a tissue culture L3 dose of between and should be used in rs serum neutralization tests and that incubation should be for to min at RT the neutralizing capacity of guinea pig IS was not increased by the use of filtered virus the rate of virus NT however was increased with the addition of hemolytic units of complement the neutralizing capacity of rs immune horse SS was much greater for filtered than for unfiltered rs virus the addition of complement increased the rate of virus NT but did not increase the neutralizing capacity of the horse IS
PG,placebo group,TS-4194,phosphodiesterases pdes are key enzymes involved in the regulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotide metabolism the aim of the present T0 was to identify and to characterize the pde isoenzymes present in the human detrusor smooth muscle human detrusor pde isoenzymes were separated by qsepharose AE and calmodulinagarose affinity chromatography and characterized upon their kinetic characteristics and their sensitivity to allosteric modulators and inhibitors all five presently known pde isoenzyme families were identified one highaffinity lowkm calciumcalmodulinstimulated pde i with a slight preference for cgmp over camp one cgmpstimulated pde ii one cgmpinhibited pde iii one campspecific pde iv and one cgmpspecific pde iv all five known pde isoenzyme families exist in human detrusor smooth musculature the kinetic characteristics together with PET in vitro studies suggest that the pde i may be oll ci to mmoll in the PG difference not significant no changes occurred in the levels of other lipids Lp or apolipoproteins with the exception of lipoproteina lpa the median changes in lpa were IQ range to and interquartile range to in the growth hormone and placebo CG respectively p we conclude that the effect of growth hormone on ldl cholesterol levels in fh is less than expected based on its ldlcatabolic effects and is counteracted by profound increases in lpa C2 resulting in unchanged levels of apolipoprotein b thus growth hormone is probably not useful as adjunctive therapy in fh
LS,lumbar spine,TS-4195,after disc removal and monosegmental instrumentation of the sheep LS interbody fusion was compared for months C2 of AB graft hydroxylapatite or rhop
TAS,total antioxidant status,TS-4196,CPR cpr is a series of lifesaving actions that improve the chance of survival following cardiac arrest ca many clinical and laboratory parameters such as the presence of asystole outofhospital cpr and duration of CA are associated with failed cpr in patients with ca asystole is a state of no cardiac electrical activity along with the absence of contractions of the myocardium and absence of cardiac SO oxidative AS index osi which is the ratio of total oxidative status to TAS increases by ischemiareperfusion injury we investigated whether osi levels in patients with ca could predict early mortality after cpr
PA,abscess,TS-4197,a female in her s underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy egd for screening and a iia lesion measuring approximately mm was detected in the descending portion of the duodenum due to the malignant potency of the lesion endoscopic SM dissection esd was performed microperforation occurred during esd the lesion was removed en bloc and the postesd ulcer bed was closed with clips the next day the patient had ABD pain and computed tomography ct revealed a small amount of free air in the RP space since there were no findings to suggest panperitonitis conservative medical management including fasting and antibiotics was continued abdominal pain subsequently improved however egd on the th day after esd for followup showed shedding of the postesd ulcer that penetrated the RP space a surgical approach was not indicated because a few days may have already passed since postoperative perforation occurred and the spread of inflammation to the retroperitoneum was suspected in an attempt to promote closure of the perforated cavity we patched PGA sheets and FG to the cavity wall on days and after esd the formation of GT was detected in the cavity one week later ct showed an PA in the right retroperitoneum for which ctguided abscess puncture was performed thereafter the cavity gradually decreased T3 the initiation of oral intake on postoperative day pod the GA condition of the patient was stable and she was discharged on pod polyglycolic acid sheets with fibrin glue and ctguided abscess puncture were useful for closing the C1 cavity that developed after duodenal postoperative perforation
PL,posterolateral,TS-4198,the vertebral i.a. C2 spinal nerves spinal nerve roots and the bony and ligamentous tissue related to the cervical vertebrae are structures whose anatomy determines the path of a surgical approach defining the anatomy and in particular determining the precise location of vulnerable structures at the intervertebral foramen and the uncovertebral foraminal region uvfr a region defined by the uncinate process anteriorly the facet joint posteriorly and the foramen transversarium laterally has critical significance when selecting the safest surgical RPA we studied the anatomy of the vertebral i.a. cervical spinal SN and spinal nerve roots within the uvfr in six cadaver specimens we also obtained measurements of bony structures in dry cervical vertebral columns from cc the uncinate process up projects superiorly from the posterolateral aspect of each cervical VB except for the first and second vertebrae because the posterior part of the up lies adjacent to the vertebral i.a. spinal nerve and spinal nerve roots its resection creates sufficient space to decompress these structures directly the PL surface of the up is covered by ligamentous tissue that originates from the posterior longitudinal ligament and protects the neural and V1 structures during their decompression in the uvfr
TCR,transcriptional control region,TS-4199,genetic factors are important in the OD of posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd following exposure to traumatic events however the molecular genetic underpinnings of this disorder have not been definitive this T0 examined the association between tryptophan hydroxylase tph rs genotype a singlenucleotide polymorphism snp located in the TCR and ptsd PS a ehÃ§ets disease bd is a rare chronic multisystemic disease of unknown cause bd is characterized by mucocutaneous ocular vascular and CNS system manifestations and is also associated with thrombogenicity in this retrospective analysis we investigated the relation between gestation and bd
LS,low salt,TS-4200,the strong geographic and social class differences in blood pressure may be related to differences in potassium intake or in the ratio of Na/K NI LS populations also have high potassium NI in japanese villages populations with similar salt intake but different blood pressures had different potassium intake in one T0 a significant rho was found between urinary nak ratio and blood pressure another T0 showed a significant negative correlation between potassium excretion and blood pressure four studies are available that show that blacks excrete much less potassium than whites one of these studies also showed by analyzing duplicate meals that blacks consumed much less potassium than whites a KCl diet tends to be more expensive than a low potassium diet potassium intake may be a major factor in the epidemiologic differences of hypertension
SR,spontaneous respiration,TS-4201,labetalol is a drug possessing both alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties its possible use in induced SH during halothane anaesthesia has been investigated it causes a satisfactory decrease in arterial pressure unaccompanied by tachycardia the circulatory effects of the drug during halothane anaesthesia both with spontaneous and controlled QO2 have been measured and compared with those of halothane alone in patients anaesthetised with HAL labetalol with both spontaneous and controlled ventilation was associated with a reduction in map from mmhg to mmhg p less than and mmhg to mmhg p less than respectively this reduction was associated with decreases in qt of and respectively in the presence of labetalol with halothane and SR the depressant effects of the anaesthetic on the heart became rapidly apparent qt was reduced by a further in patients not receiving labetalol the depressant effects of halothane were frequently countered by the positive inotropic effects of hypercarbia
CS,conditioning stimulation,TS-4202,reciprocal reflex connections were studied in capsular hemiplegia and spastic paresis with spinal cord lesions using lloyds technique effects of CS of the tibial or peroneal nerve on the h reflex in the antagonists were examined stimulus intensity was controlled with REF to the threshold of the m wave weaker stimulation than this threshold was regarded as stimulation of GI afferents it aroused no subjection sensation in intact subjects early and strong inhibition comparable to ia inhibition in the cat lloyd was observed from weak stimulation of the TN on the pretibial flexor h reflex but not from the peroneal nerve on the ts extensor h reflex in capsular hemiplegia alcohol block of extensor motor points resulted in reduction of spasticity without further paralysis in the blocked muscle and a remarkable increase in strength of the antagonist pretibial muscles these results suggest that an extensor spasticity withe flexor weakness which is common in capsular hemiplegia may be due to an imbalance of reflex MICs via ia muscle afferents and that a part of flexor weakness can be restored by DIS by reduction of ia inflow from extensor muscles ia inhibition was also observed in one third of cases with spinal cord lesions at rest it returned to normal after REC from spastic paresis by radical therapy in some cases
TI,tuberoinfundibular,TS-4203,in our previous studies patients with schizophrenia and their parents had less frequent eye fixations and a more limited area of inspection than normal controls while freely viewing stationary sshaped figures the present T0 attempted to discriminate schizophrenics from nonschizophrenics using exploratory eye movements two CG a and b were formed each comprising schizophrenic and nonschizophrenic subjects each of patients with depression methamphetamine psychosis alcohol psychosis anxiety disorder temporal lobe epilepsy FL lesions and healthy normal controls DA was performed on group a to obtain a discriminant the validity of applying this discriminant to group b was investigated by focussing on exploratory eye movements schizophrenics could be discriminated from nonschizophrenicsof plasma prl at e but not at e while the pituitary content of prl remained unchanged the same treatment at e caused a significant increase of the prl concentration in plasma and a concomitant fall in the PIT that could be prevented by preliminary encephalectomy these data show that the TI da system begins to inhibit prl PR from lactotropes between e and e CR arresting prl PR from the PIT in males but not in females
RP,red pulp,TS-4204,tissue macrophages comprise a heterogeneous group of cell types differing in location surface markers and CF RP macrophages are a distinct splenic subset involved in removing senescent red blood cells transcription factors such as pu also known as sfpi and cebpalpha cebpa have general roles in myelomonocytic development but the transcriptional basis for producing tissue macrophage subsets remains unknown here we show that spic encoded by spic a purelated transcription factor selectively controls the development of red pulp macrophages spic is highly expressed in red pulp macrophages but not monocytes dendritic cells or other tissue macrophages spic mice have a cellautonomous defect in the OD of red pulp macrophages that is corrected by retroviral spic expression in bone marrow cells but have normal monocyte and other macrophage subsets RP macrophages highly express genes involved in capturing circulating haemoglobin and in iron regulation spic mice show normal trapping of red blood cells in the SP but fail to phagocytose these red blood cells efficiently and develop an iron overload localized selectively to splenic red pulp thus spic controls development of RP macrophages required for red blood cell recycling and iron homeostasis
OP,organophosphorous,TS-4205,the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase ache activity has been used widely as a biomarker of SE to OP pesticides ops however scientific uncertainty about the risk assessment implications of data describing inhibition of cholinesterases in diverse species and tissues has hampered the use of ache activity as a biomarker of adverse effect here haemolymph ache activity was combined with biomarkers of cellular integrity immunotoxicity and physiological status in order to measure exposure to and the effects of the priority pollutant chlorfenvinphos laboratory exposures of the blue mussel mytilus edulis to commercial grade chlorfenvinphos sapecron were conducted over and h ache activity in haemolymph of m edulis was highly VL and bore no relationship to either sublethal effects or lethality over the range mgl chlorfenvinphos in comparison concentration dependent inhibition was evident for each of the remaining biomarkers phagocytic activity spontaneous cytotoxicity NR PR time total haemolymph protein mussels at the highest exposure concentration showed visual signs of neurotoxicity impaired neuromuscular control haemocyte phagocytic activity and spontaneous cytotoxicity responses were highly sensitive to chlorfenvinphos with significant modulati the pm and vice versa the tod effects in young and old rats in the dnmts and dnmtsr tests were strongest at relatively long delays suggesting that HPC function may be particularly vulnerable to such effects there was evidence in the old rats of a relationship between diurnal drinking patterns and performance at the longest delay in the dnmts test these results which parallel similar findings with human subjects emphasize a linkage between circadian rhythmicity and cognitive performance throughout adulthood and indicate the importance of circadian disruption in old age as a contributing factor to age differences in learning and SM performance
SG,stellate ganglion,TS-4206,a study was made of the conditions of the occurrence and mechanisms of the enhancement by the sympathetic nerve of the vagusinduced inhibition of rabbit heart work it was discovered that to obtain such a phenomenon it is necessary that stimulation of the SG be made in the presence of perithreshold stimulation of the vagus after blockade of betaadrenoreceptors the inhibitory effect was not abolished by dihydroergotoxin but was blocked by promedol aminazine and diprazine it is suggested that the serotoninergic component is involved in the mechanism of the enhancement of the vagusinduced inhibition that occurs during stimulation of the sympathetic nerve
ER,energy restriction,TS-4207,thirty obese women were randomly assigned to either severe ER ser or moderate ER mer of their maintenance energy requirements and to no exercise AE walking or AE plus CWT BC by hydrostatic weighing and energy expenditure by IC were measured at and mo in addition we developed a deficitefficiency factor def calculated as body SE lossdietary energy deficit to attempt to quantify the effectiveness of the weightreduction interventions subjects in the ser group lost more weight mean se vs kg fat vs kg and fatfree mass vs kg than the mer group p or however the overall def was greatest in the mer group compared with the ser group p or exercise had no significant effect this T0 demonstrates that mer may offer an advantage over ser because it produces a greater energy loss relative to SE deficit
LP,serum lipoprotein,TS-4208,the administration of tamoxifen tam a nonsteroidal antiestrogen or of a diphenylmethane derivative of tam that does not bind to the estrogen receptor dppe of cockerels results in a marked decrease in the concentration of LP constituents with an apparent alteration in phospholipid composition to establish the nature of changes in phospholipids the molecular species of phosphatidylcholine pc and sphingomyelin sph were isolated and characterized between and hr following the administration of tam or dppe there was a marked decrease in the proportion of molecular species of SS pc containing c and c fatty acids but there was an increase in the proportion of molecular species containing c and c PUFA fatty acids fatty acid analyses revealed that this NC was due to an increase in AA and docosahexaenoic acids at the expense of oleic and linoleic acids these proportional changes were due to an absolute decrease in SS of pc molecular species containing palmitic and stearic acids in association with OA and linoleic acids with very little NC in the absolute concentration of molecular species containing arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids by contrast the composition of sph which contained palmitic acid as the L1 fatty acid was not altered during treatment it is concluded that the shortterm effect of tam and dppe on plasma phospholipids of the cockerel is due to a selective conservation of pc containing long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
MS,marbling score,TS-4209,feed intake has been shown to alter neurological signaling related to FF SMB and subsequent activation of adipogenic mechanisms fat characteristics are pivotal for carcass and meat quality including MS flavor and tenderness the objective of this T0 was to establish the association of snp from genes functionally related to fat metabolism and obesity with growth fat and carcass traits in steers a total of informative snp from candidate genes CART cart dnaprotein kinase dnapk HFA synthase fasn and fat mass and obesity associated fto were used to genotype crossbred steers n and associations with growth and carcass traits were assessed five markers within the dnapk gene were associated p with fat thickness one of these snp was also associated p with percent choice yield grade and retail product yield additionally unique dnapk snp were associated p with MS three haplotypes were observed using these snp and were significantly p associated with marbling score slaughter weight adg and hcw were associated p with snp from cart fto and fasn data from this T0 indicate that polymorphisms within candidate genes have an indirect relationship with lipogenesis replication of these results within other populations will be necessary to establish if these markers will be successful as predictors of fatness components and carcass traits in cattle

SA,skeletal age,TS-4225,longitudinal data from a T0 of child development in guatemala city were used to describe the influence of SES status and sex on physical and cognitive growth status the correlation between the growth status variables was also analyzed the sample included guatemalan children of low ses of middle ses and of high ses the children were students in urban primary schools physical variables height weight and skeletal age were measured annually from first to sixth grade two cognitive variables general intelligence and reading ability were measured in grades or significant differences between ses groups existed for all variables however the differences in each grade were greater for the cognitive measures than for the physical measures compared with high ses children middle ses boys and low ses boys and girls experienced significantly greater delayed growth in height than in weight or skeletal age it is possible that these height delays may result in a permanent reduction in stature the only consistently significant sexrelated difference was for SA girls were more mature than boys in each grade when ses was statistically controlled there was no significant correlation between PCS and cognitive growth status for girls and only a few moderate but statistically significant correlations for boys
SC,scrotal circumference,TS-4226,field data records on HH and brangus bulls between and d of age were analyzed to find age of calf and age of dam adjustment factors for yearling SC age of calf adjustment AF were cmd for HH bulls and cmd for brangus bulls sons of hereford dams were adjusted to a to yr dam age basis by adding or cm for dams or or more years old respectively age of dam adjustment AF for brangus bulls were and for dams or or more years old respectively variance and covariance components for yearling scrotal circumference and several growth traits were estimated within breed using multipletrait models and pseudo expectations involving the solutions and the righthand sides of the mixedmodel equations additive heritability estimates for yearling scrotal circumference of and were found for HH and brangus bulls respectively maternal heritability estimates of and were found for HH and brangus bulls respectively genetic correlations between yearling scrotal circumference and other growth traits were positive for both sets of data indicating that selection for yearling SC should not adversely affect other growth traits in either breed environmental rho estimates between yearling scrotal circumference and adjusted birth weight and between yearling SC and adjusted d weight and adjusted d height were positive and moderate in magnitude for both breeds
RS,response signal,TS-4227,protein glutathionylation is a protective mechanism that functions in response to mild oxidative AS carbon monoxide co can increase the ROS species concentration from a low level via the inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase we therefore hypothesized that co would induce nfÎºbp glutathionylation and then show antiinflammatory effects in this T0 we found that coreleasing molecules suppress tnfÎ±induced mo adhesion to EC cells ecs and reduce icam expression moreover co donors were further found to exert their inhibitory effects by blocking nfÎºbp nuclear translocation but do so independent of iÎºbÎ± degradation in tnfÎ±treated ecs in addition p protein glutathionylation represents the RS to co donors and is reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol thiol modification of the cysteine residue in the p rhd region was required for the comodulated nfÎºb activation the suppression of p glutathionylation by a gsh synthesis inhibitor bso and by catalase could also attenuate tnfÎ±induced p nuclear translocation and icam expression co donors induce nrf activation and nrf sirna suppresses coinduced p glutathionylation and inhibition furthermore we found that the co donors induce heme oxygenase ho expression which increases p glutathionylation in contrast ho sirna attenuates co donor and hemininduced p glutathionylation our results thus indicate that the glutathionylation of p is likely to be responsible for comediated nfÎºb inactivation and that the hodependent pathway may prolong the GABA effects of co donors upon tnfÎ± treatment of ecs
NS,nodular sclerosis,TS-4228,we have developed a R2 of the solidphase enzymelinked immunosorbent CA elisa to enable measurement of the activity and antigen C2 of protein c pc in HP with this CA it is possible to do both tests with the same sample and same microtiter SP coated with antipc monoclonal antibody mcajtc which inhibited neither activation of pc nor activity of APC apc even in patients undergoing heparin treatment for severe disseminated intravascular coagulation there were no detectable differences between amidolytic romyelocytic leukemia was the only cell type other than eosinophils to be recognized by the antibody because previous reports have described occult eosinophilic degranulation in tissues with a variety of pathological conditions we immunostained cryostat sections of four consecutive CL node biopsies of NS HD disease with the monoclonal antibody our objective was to characterize by IH the eosinophilic infiltration in a lymphoma that frequently contains substantial numbers of eosinophils in all four cases of NS HD disease there was striking and extensive deposition of epo in a dendritic pattern throughout the connective tissue and collagen bands the extent of deposition of epo in the bands far exceeded the degree of infiltration by intact eosinophils as determined by examination of routinely stained tissue sections a similar dendritic pattern was not observed in any of six benign lymph NO that were immunostained for epo we conclude that the monoclonal antibody described in this report is specific for epo and that eosinophils extensively degranulate and PR epo in the bands of nodular sclerosis HD disease moreover the degree of eosinophilic infiltration in this disorder cannot be assessed solely on the basis of intact eosinophils

AS,ammonium sulfate,TS-4230,the presence of microorganisms producing cell wall hydrolyzing enzymes such as xylanases during malting can improve mash filtration behavior and consequently have potential for more efficient wort production in this T0 the xylanolytic bacterial community during malting was assessed by isolation and cultivation on growth media containing arabinoxylan and identification by s rrna gene sequencing a total of specieslevel operational taxonomic units otus were found taking into account a sequence dissimilarity cutoff belonging to four phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria and genera predominant otus represented xylanolytic bacteria identified as sphingobacterium multivorum stenotrophomonas maltophilia aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fulva dna fingerprinting of all xylanolytic isolates belonging to s multivorum obtained in this T0 revealed shifts in s multivorum populations during the process xylanase activity was determined for a selection of isolates with cellulomonas flavigena showing the highest activity the xylanase of this species was isolated and purified fold by UF AS precipitation and deaeff IEC and appeared relatively TS this T0 will enhance our understanding of the role of microorganisms in the barley germination process in addition this T0 may provide a basis for microflora management during malting
CD,chlordecone,TS-4231,estrogenic pesticides such as ddt and CD generate deleterious reproductive effects an in SC bioassay was used to assess the estrogenicity of several pesticides the escreen test uses human breast estrogensensitive mcf cells and compares the cell yield achieved after days of culture in medium supplemented with charcoaldextran stripped human SS in the presence PC or absence negative control of estradiol and with diverse concentrations of xenobiotics suspected of being estrogenic among the organochlorine pesticides tested toxaphene dieldrin and endosulfan had estrogenic properties comparable to those of ddt and CD the latter are known to be estrogenic in rodent models the escreen test also revealed that estrogenic chemicals may act cumulatively when mixed together they induce estrogenic responses at concentrations lower than those required when each compound is administered CT
GN,guanine nucleotides,TS-4232,evidence continues to accumulate that strengthens the proposal of heterogeneity within both the at and the at receptor subtypes pharmacologic biochemical and immunological studies of at receptors expressed in ne cells strengthen the hypothesis of at receptor heterogeneity however it is important to reassess these studies especially in terms of how these results correlate with other reports of at receptor heterogeneity for example at receptor immunoreactivity was absent in some neuronal regions which have previously been proposed to express the at receptor AT1 in particular at receptor IF was not seen in the inferior olive a region which is known to express a HD of at receptors upon first examination these results were somewhat troubling however when compared with earlier reports these results should not have been unexpected for instance tsutsumi and saaverdra previously have shown that at receptors in the locus coeruleus are CS to the actions of GN while at receptors in the IO are insensitive these antisera were raised against a population of at receptors which are CS to gtp gamma s and therefore the lack of at receptor IF in the inferior olive as well as the presence of at receptor immunoreactivity in the locus coeruleus confirms and extends these earlier reports in addition the at receptors expressed in the LC have been shown to be functionally distinct from at receptors in the VPI olive in this regard ang ii has been shown to depress glutamateinduced epsps in the locus coeruleus an effect which is mediated through the at receptor conversely at receptors have been shown to increase the firing rate of neurons in the IO collectively these results would predict that IF should be absent in the VPI olive using these atdirected antisera indeed in view of these earlier physiological and pharmacological studies the presence of at receptor immunoreactivity in the IO would have been surprising the most convincing example of at receptor heterogeneity is the characterization of at receptors present in ne cells separation of solubilized ne CM by heparinsepharose chromatography generates two populations of at receptors which are pharmacologically and biochemically distinct in particular cgpa was approximately orders of magnitude more selective for peak iii at receptors than was pd binding activity of peak i and peak iii at receptor populations also differed in their responses to gtp gamma s and dtt treatment lastly the atdirected antisera raised against the peak i population of at receptors were not able to immunodetect the peak iii population of at receptors in immunoblot analysis or immunoprecipiatate at CBA from peak iii material pharmacological PSA and immunological analysis of the at receptor clone isolated from ne cells revealed that it has the MZ characteristics or properties of the peak iii receptor the at receptor isolated from ne cells exhibited a similar pharmacology as the peak iii at receptor in that cgpa was more effective at displacing iang ii CBA than was pd the at receptor clone was also shown to be insensitive to the actions of gtp gamma s as well as demonstrated increased CBA in the presence of dtt MZ to the peak iii at receptor lastly immunoblot analysis of membranes prepared from cos cells transfected with the at receptor cdna from ne cells did not demonstrate any immunespecific bands with the atdirected antisera characterization of an at receptor cdna isolated from ne cells reveals that this clone is identical to the peak iii type of at receptor

DL,dominant lethal,TS-4235,a summary of the results of the studies conducted in the eu project multiendpoint analysis of genetic damage induced by butadiene and its L1 metabolites in somatic and germ cells of mice rats and man is presented results of the project are summarized on the PCD of dna and hemoglobin adducts on the cytotoxic and clastogenic effects in somatic and germinal cells of mice and rats on the induction of somatic mutations at the hprt locus of exp rodents and occupationally exposed workers on the induction of DLM in mice and rats and on heritable translocations induced in mice after SE to butadiene bd or its L1 metabolites butadiene monoepoxide bmo diepoxybutane deb and butadiene diolepoxide bde the primary goal of this project was to collect exp data on the genetic effects of bd in order to estimate the germ cell genetic risk to humans of SE to bd to achieve this the butadiene exposure are based on data for heritable translocations and bone marrow micronuclei induced in mice and chromosome aberrations observed in lymphocytes of exposed workers a doubling dose for heritable translocations in human germ cells of ppmh is estimated which assuming cumulative bd exposure over the sensitive period of spermatogenesis corresponds to weeks of continuous exposure at the workplace to ppm alternatively the rate of heritable translocation induction per ppmh of bd SE is estimated to be approximately per million live born compared to a spontaneous incidence of balanced translocations in humans of approximately per million live born these estimates have large confidence intervals and are only intended to indicate orders of magnitude of human genetic risk these risk estimates are based on data from germ cells of bdexposed male mice the demonstration that clastogenic damage was induced by deb in preovulatory oocytes at doses which were not ovotoxic implies that additional studies on the response of rat female germ cells to bd and its metabolites are needed the basic assumption of the above genetic risk estimates is that experimental mouse data obtained T3 bd SE can be extrapolated to humans several points exist in the present report and in the literature which contradict this assumption the level of bmohemoglobin adducts was significantly elevated in bdexposed workers however it was considerably lower than would have been predicted from comparable rat and mouse exposures the concentrations of the metabolites deb and bmo were significantly higher in mouse than in rat blood T3 bd SE thus while metabolism of bd is qualitatively similar in the two species it is quantitatively different no increase of hprt mutations was shown in workers exposed on average to ppm of bd while in a different population of workers from a us plant exposed on average to ppm of bd a significant increase of hprt SCV was detected and data from cancer bioassays and cancer epidemiology suggest that rat is a more appropriate model than mouse for human cancer risk from bd SE however the DL T0 in rats gave a negative result at present we do not know which bd metabolites may be responsible for the genetic effects even though the bifunctional alkylating agent deb is the most likely candidate for the induction of clastogenic events unfortunately methods to measure deb adducts in hemoglobin or dna are only presently being developed despite these several uncertainties the use of the mouse genetic data is regarded as a justifiable and conservative RPA to human genetic risk estimation given the considerable heterogeneity observed in the biotransformation of bd in humans
GC,glucocorticosteroids,TS-4236,ru MIF has proved to be a remarkably active antiprogesterone and antiglucocorticosteroid agent in human beings the mechanism of action involves the intracellular receptors of the antagonized hormones progesterone and GC at the molecular level the most important features are high binding affinity to the receptor interaction of the phenylaminodimethyl group in the betaposition with a specific region of the receptor IB pocket and ruinduced transconformation differences in the ligandbinding domain these particularities have consequences at different steps of the receptor CF as compared with agonists however the reasoning cannot be limited to the rureceptor interaction and for instance there is the possibility of a switch from antagonistic property to agonist activity depending on the MI of other signaling pathways it would be desirable to have derivatives with only one of the two antagonistic properties antiprogestin antiglucocorticosteroid in spite of similarities between steroid structures receptors involved and responsive machineries in target cells clinically the ruplusprostaglandin method is ready to be used on a C1 scale and is close to being as convenient and safe as any medical method of abortion may be the early use of ru as a contragestive as soon as a woman fears a pregnancy she does not want will help to defuse the abortion issue research should now be conducted to define an efficient and convenient contraceptive method with ru or other antiprogestins the usefulness of ru for obstetric indications including facilitation of difficult delivery has to be assessed rapidly gynecologic trials particularly in leiomyomata should be systemically continued the very preliminary results obtained with PT including breast cancers indicate that further studies are necessary
DR,darkreared,TS-4237,most pathologies of the outer retina include physiological and morphological changes in the PE the question of PE involvement in retinal CS damage caused by low intensities of CS is still unresolved in the present T0 we investigated the effects of low intensity cyclic CS on PE function in albino rats the SF-36 of the PE was assessed electrophysiologically from dc recordings of erg cwaves and sodium azide induced changes in the resting potential responses obtained from albino rats raised under low intensity cyclic CS ft cd ld were compared to those obtained from albino rats raised under minimal CS SE conditions darkreared and pigmented rats housed under low intensity cyclic CS we report for the first time that albino rats raised from birth under low intensity cyclic CS possess cwaves their responses were comparable in amplitude and RL to those recorded from pigmented rats housed under similar conditions but were significantly smaller than those recorded from DR albino rats the reduction in the amplitudes of the cwaves recorded from cyclic lightreared albino rats was probably not due to retinal CS damage comparisons of the amplitudes and latencies of erg bwaves recorded from cyclic lightreared and darkreared albino rats did not suggest that the retinas of the cyclic lightreared albino rats had been damaged by light LM examination of these retinas also provided no evidence for light damage the transient positive potential changes recorded from cyclic lightreared albino rats in response to bolus i.v. of sodium azide were significantly smaller than those recorded from either DR albino rats or pigmented rats housed under low intensity cyclic light the results of these experiments suggest that the PE of albino rats is functionally altered by extremely low intensiapical pits of chloride cells the surface of il facing the capsular space was characterized by a ML of cells possessing extensive anastomosing plasmalemmal processes the ol was composed of several tiers of fibroblasts and associated collagen fibrils that adhered to the brain surface in the form of a thickened pia mater it is suggested that the capsule was formed by a modification of the pia that isolated the nymph and created an intracapsular space with specialized lining cells to facilitate fluid exchange
IO,intraosseous,TS-4238,intraosseous administration of resuscitation medications and fluids in PT and term neonates is an alternative when intravascular access is not possible with intravenous catheters or needles intraosseous access is rarely needed in neonates because of the availability of clinicians with expert technical skills for placement of intravenous catheters in neonatal icus the presence of the UV during the first DAB when most resuscitations occur and the predominance of resuscitations being responsive to positivepressure ventilation alone IO access is most likely to be needed in outofhospital settings and in hospitalized infants without intravenous access who have V1 collapse secondary to shock or when clinicians responsible for VA during resuscitations are more skilled in IO access than intravenous access
SM,salmeterol,TS-4239,quantitative macroraman spectroscopy was applied to the analysis of the bulk composition of pharmaceutical drug powders powders were extracted from seven commercial lactosecarrierbased drypowder inhalers flixotide and Î¼gdose four concentrations of FP and seretide and Î¼gdose three concentrations of FP each with Î¼gdose SM xinafoate also a carrierfree pressurized metereddose inhaler of the same combination product seretide Î¼g FP and Î¼g SM xinafoate per dose was tested the applicability of a customdesigned dispersive macroraman SF-36 with a large sample volume of Î¼l was tested to determine the composition of the multicomponent powder samples to quantify the error caused by sample heterogeneity a MC model was developed to predict the minimum sample volume required for representative sampling of potentially heterogeneous samples at the microscopic level characterized by different particlesize distributions and compositions typical carrierfree respirable powder samples required a minimum sample volume on the order of Î¼l to achieve representative sampling with less than relative error in contrast dosage forms containing nonrespirable carriers eg lactose required a sample volume on the order of Î¼l for representative measurements error analysis of the exp results showed good PA with the error predicted by the simulation

PN,phrenic nerve,TS-4241,hereditary motor and PSN CMT disease is characterized by chronic degeneration of peripheral SN and roots resulting in distal muscle atrophy beginning in the feet and legs and later involving the hands the association of this disease with DIA dysfunction has not been reported we studied a patient with hereditary motor and PSN type CMT disease and type diabetes mellitus who had severe DIA impairment some of the clinical findings are similar to the SA syndrome which could lead to incorrect diagnosis and delay in the administration of appropriate therapy transdiaphragmatic pressure studies on the subjects brother who also has charcotmarietooth disease and type diabetes mellitus revealed subclinical impairment of DIA CF these findings suggest that PN involvement may be part of the spectrum of polyneuropathy in charcotmarietooth disease in association with diabetes mellitus
PI,polyphosphoinositide,TS-4242,several low molecular weight g proteins have been identified but their PET roles remain unclear to clarify the involvement of low molecular weight g protein in receptorstimulated turnover of PI pi turnover influences of botulinum toxins on serotonin htstimulated cl current mediated by pi turnover were investigated using xenopus oocytes injected with rat BB mrna treatment with botulinum toxin c d or purified ADPRT of botulinum toxin botulinum toxin c enzyme inhibited the htinduced cl current in oocytes and adpribosylated kda proteins both botulinum toxin c enzymeinduced inhibition of the current and adpribosylation were suppressed by pretreatment with antibotulinum toxin c enzyme antibody botulinum toxin d treatment of oocytes was ineffective in the response of cl current induced by i.t. of pmol Ins trisphosphate and pmol ca it is suggested that low molecular weight g proteins adpribosylated by botulinum toxin c enzyme are involved in phospholipase c activation in xenopus oocytes
FP,footpad,TS-4243,four groups of TPS pathogenfree dayold chicks were infected experimentally with an avian arthrotropic reovirus CS r by four different routesoral subcutaneous FP and intraarticular these CG were followed sequentially to study pathological changes in the hock joints and CL cloacal virus shedding and the presence of virus in hock joints serological responses as determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa agar gel precipitation agp and virus NT tests all infected groups developed arthritis or tenosynovitis with synovial PH and lymphocytic infiltration footpad and intraarticular routes of infection were found to advance the disease process by to weeks after infection by these routes were associated with superficial degenerative changes in articular cartilage antibodies were detected at to weeks pi by all methods but there were no significant differences between the patterns of serological response in the INF CG injection into the FP appears to be the most convenient and effective parenteral route of experimental infection

MS,mass spectrometric,TS-4246,we report a protein labeling method using nonselective carbene reactions of sufficiently high efficiency to permit detection by MS methods the approach uses a diazirinemodified CAA laminoazipentanoic acid photoleucine as a label source which is converted to a highly reactive carbene by pulsed laser photolysis at nm labeling of standard proteins and MMP cam mb m was achieved with yields up to fold higher than previous studies using methylene carbene labeling is CS to changes in protein topography brought about by conformational NC and ligand IB the modification of apocam was Â± higher than that of holocam modification of the camm complex reflected a Â± reduction in labeling for bound holocam relative to free holocam labeling yield is independent of protein concentration over approximately orders of magnitude but is weakly dependent on the presence of other chromophores in a photonlimited apparatus the current configuration required min of irradiation for full reagent conversion however it is shown that comparable yields can be achieved with a single highenergy laser PP mjpulse ns offering a labeling method with high temporal resolution we suggest a mechanism of labeling governed by limited carbene diffusion and the protein surface activity of the diazirine precursor this surface activity is speculated to return a measure of selectivity relative to methylene labeling which ultimately may be tunable
LP,linear programming,TS-4247,in this paper we propose to use LP methods or a more specialized method namely the hungarian method for speeding up the exact calculation of an edit distance for marked point processes y hirata and k aihara chaos the key observation is that the problem of calculating the edit distance reduces to a matching problem on a bipartite graph our preliminary numerical results show that the proposed implementations are faster than the conventional ones by a factor of
NP,nucleoside phosphorylase,TS-4248,forodesine is a new and potent purine NP pnp inhibitor patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll with primary resistance to fludarabinebased therapy or with progressive disease were eligible for oral forodesine mgd for up to weeks eight patients with median lymphocyte count of x l and median serum BMG level of mgl were treated six had rai stage iii to iv and were previously heavily treated median prior therapy two had transient decrease in lymphocyte count to normal whereas in disease progressed AEs were mild steadystate level of forodesine ranged from to nm and did not reach desired microm level pnp inhibition ranged from to and steadystate deoxyguanosine dguo concentration median was microm intracellular deoxyguanosine triphosphate dgtp increase was very modest from median of microm to microm compared with in vivo in vitro incubations of cll lymphocytes with or microm dguo and forodesine microm resulted in accumulation of higher levels of dgtp microm which resulted in increase in apoptosis forodesine has biologic activity in cll pharmacodynamic parameters suggest that an alternate dosing schedule andor higher doses to achieve greater intracellular dgtp may be beneficial in this patient population

CF,crevicular fluid,TS-4250,the aim of this T0 was to determine whether the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug flurbiprofen which has been shown to be an inhibitor of ABL in human periodontal disease is present in human CF cf following oral dosing a method is described whereby routine highperformance liquid chromatography is used to detect the drug in only microliters of cf volunteers abstained from toothbrushing for days to induce experimental gingivitis and increase the resting flow of cf mg of flurbiprofen was taken by each volunteer on d on d and SS and cf samples were taken prior to dosing and afterwards at and hours on d the mean peak concentration of the drug in serum was about microgramsml and was found between h T3 dosing the respective values for cf d were microgramsml and h on d flurbiprofen was detected in both fluids prior to dosing the mean peak concentrations after dosing had increased to microgramsml SS and microgramsml cf although the C2 of the drug in cf remained relatively constant throughout the observation period on d the results indicate that flurbiprofen may be detected in human cf T3 p.o. and that the C2 are in excess of the plasma level which in beagles has been shown to inhibit ABL in periodontal disease
RPE,retinal pigment epithelial cells,TS-4251,cilia and flagella are eukaryotic organelles involved in multiple cellular functions the primary cilium is generally non motile and found in numerous vertebrate cell types where it controls key signalling pathways despite a common architecture ultrastructural data suggest some differences in their organisation here we report the first detailed characterisation of the ciliary pocket a depression of the plasma membrane in which the primary cilium is rooted this structure is found at low frequency in kidney epithelial cells imcd but is associated with virtually all primary cilia in RPE rpe transmission and scanning electron microscopy immunofluorescence analysis and videomicroscopy revealed that the ciliary pocket establishes closed links with the actinbased cytoskeleton and that it is EC in AS and dynamic clathrincoated pits the existence of the ciliary pocket was confirmed in mouse tissues bearing primary cilia cumulus as well as motile cilia and flagella ependymal cells and spermatids the ciliary pocket shares striking morphological and PET similarities with the flagellar pocket of trypanosomatids a traffickingspecialised membrane domain at the base of the flagellum our data therefore highlight the conserved role of membrane trafficking in the vicinity of cilia

CSD,cortical spreading depression,TS-4258,the effect of piracetam ucb pyrrolidoneacetamide on learning mediated by transcommissural information flow was studied in hooded rats acquisition of monocular pattern discrimination was faster in drugtreated rats mgkg min before training than in UT controls subsequent relearning with one hemisphere functionally eliminated by CSD showed that the strength of the primary engram formed under piracetam in the hemisphere CL to the TR eye remained unaffected but that the AA trace in the ipsilateral hemisphere was considerably improved and almost equalled the primary one savings increased from to learning with uncrossed optic SF was unaffected by the drug interhemispheric transfer of lateralized visual engrams acquired during functional hemidecortication was facilitated by piracetam administration preceding the five transfer trials performed with the untrained eye open imperative transfer PIR was ineffective when the TR eye was open during transfer trials facultative transfer T3 a visual engram had been lateralized by days of monocular overtraining piracetam facilitated formation of the AA engram induced by interocular transfer trials it is concluded that piracetam enhances transcommissural encoding mechanisms G1 in the initial stage of monocular learning and in some forms of interhemispheric transfer but does not affect the transcommissural readout this effect is interpreted as a special case of the piracetaminduced facilitation of the phylogenetically old mechanisms of redundant information storage which improve liminal or subnormal learning
ESC,european society of cardiology,TS-4259,the new guidelines from the EU atherosclerosis society and the ESC include a number of new items here we demonstrate their application in several different clinical examples we focus on the items most pertinent for medical practice the stratification of risk of cardiovascular disease into categories very high high moderate and low risk involvingfor primary prevention casesthe use of the score table which has been calibrated for belgium and where the risk can be adjusted according to hdl cholesterol and the presence of other risk factors the choice of more stringent therapeutic targets for ldl cholesterol mgdl for very high risk patients mgdl for high risk patients and mgdl for patients at moderate risk the choice of other therapeutic targets nonhdl cholesterol and apolipoprotein b C2 for patients at very high or high risk with combined dyslipidaemia and followup of lipid parameters and muscular and hepatic enzymatic profiles
DMF,dimethyl formamide,TS-4260,in ref nat nanotechnol interesting optoelectronic properties of znographene oxide go composite were presented essentially in the luminescence spectrum indirect optical transitions were identified to be from the epoxy group of go goepoxy to the valance band ev of zno viz nm l lumogoepoxyâ\x86\x92ev and nm l lumogoepoxyâ\x86\x92ev furthermore the emission peak at â\x88¼ nm was attributed to zinc interstitials znis or oxygen vacancies vos and shown to span from nm equivalent to a width of â\x88¼ ev in this report we accentuate two vital though largely ignored concerns as itemized in the following i by considering the growth mechanism of zno in the composite there is a certain possibility that these two bands l and l may originate from intrinsic defects of zno such as znis and D2 znis exznis or l and l might be intrinsic to go ii the nm emission involves vos and consists of two components with a typical width of â\x88¼ ev here we present the results of a thorough investigation confirming the presence of znis exznis and intrinsic emission from go we also note that during the synthesis the presence of DMF significantly affected the emission from go in addition to some chemical modifications apart from these we have discussed other crucial factors which require deeper attention in the context of luminescence from complex systems such as those present

IEC,international electrotechnical commission,TS-4262,in the rat cytochrome pa gene expression is thought to be regulated by several transacting AF including the s polycyclic Ah pahbinding protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been suggested to influence the CF of many cytosolic receptors and transcription factors the atp level within hiie rat hepatoma cells could be depleted by treatment with sodium azide or dinitrophenol restoration of the original atp levels occurred with addition of gl to the CC atp SD reduced the phosphate content of the s protein by approximately which lowered the IB of benzoapyrene according to the din standards on an international level standards for these tests have been developed by the iec IEC iec series however these standards have so far not been applied in nationwide SQ programmes in any country typical aspects of both din and iec standards are demonstrated for direct radiography and indirect radioscopy and indirect radiography as examples din standards optimise test procedures for minimum effort and cost efficiency designed for execution even in small hospitals and practices by the users for each type of xray equipment tests are performed with only one universal test device which is precisely specified and independent of local conditions oplimisation is misation is missing for iec test procedures they are designed for more performance characteristics and need for each xray equipment more individual test devices which are mostly open for local choice and need a considerably higher effort in respect of time consumption and test films compared to din adoption of the iec standards for the constancy tests in germany would involve considerable financial and organisational effort which is probably not counterbalanced by an increased benefit
GM,galactomannan,TS-4263,fenugreek seeds are known for their characteristic smell of soup seasoning and as an ingredient of indian curry traditionally the seeds are used as macerate for the treatment of diabetes cough and flatulence to increase BM secretion and for antiinflammatory and aphrodisiac effects the use is limited by its unpleasant smell and bitter taste which can be modified by adding mint leaves to the macerate antidiabetic properties are attributed mainly to GM hydroxyisoleucin ohile diosgenin and trigonelline these substances demonstrate direct anprecedented research interest due to very rare coexistence of these two phenomena the focus has been mainly put into the proximity induced effects like coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity higher critical current triplet superconductivity etc however very little attention has been paid experimentally to the role of magnetic constituent on triggering phase slip processes in the composite films cfs we demonstrate that less than at of magnetic contribution in the cfs can initiate phase slip events efficiently due to T3 stateoftheart fabrication techniques phase slip based studies have been concentrated mainly on SC nanostructures here we employ wide mesoscopic nbgd based cfs to T0 the phase slip processes LT currentvoltage characteristics ivcs of cfs show stairlike features originated through phase slip events and are absent in pure sc films depending on the bias current and temperature distinct regions dominated by abrikosov type vortexantivortex vav pairs and phase slip events are observed the results presented here open a new way to study the phase slip mechanism its interaction with vav pairs in two dimensions and hence can be useful for future photonic and metrological applications
AS,active,TS-4264,habitat characterisation is a pivotal step of any animal ecology T0 the choice of variables used to describe habitats is crucial and need to be relevant to the ecology and behaviour of the species in order to reflect biologically meaningful distribution patterns in many species acoustic communication is critical to individuals interactions and it is expected that ambient acoustic conditions impact their local CSD yet classic animal ecology rarely integrates an acoustic dimension in habitat descriptions here we show that ambient sound pressure level spl is a strong predictor of calling site selection in acoustically active frog species in comparison to six other habitatrelated variables ie air and water temperature depth width and slope of the stream ATP spl had the most important explanatory power in microhabitat selection for the sampled species ambient noise was particularly useful in differentiating two streamassociated guilds torrents and calmer streams dwelling species guild definitions were strongly supported by spl whereas Mw which is commonly used in streamassociated habitat had a weak explanatory power moreover Mw measures are nonstandardized across studies and are difficult to assess at small scale we argue that including an acoustic descriptor will improve habitatspecies analyses for many acoustically AS taxa spl integrates habitat topology and temporal information such as weather and hour of the day for example and is a simple and precise measure we suggest that habitat description in animal ecology should include an acoustic measure such as noise level because it may explain previously misunderstood distribution patterns
CT,chorda tympani,TS-4265,acetylcholinesterase ache IF is associated with terminal fields of the glossopharyngeal and chorda tympani SN in the nucleus of the solitary tract nst to address ache function at these sites the location of the IF was examined at the fine structural level in combination with the labeling of chorda tympani nerve fibers with BD in golden syrian hamsters ache staining was located in the endoplasmic reticulum of geniculate ganglion neuronal somata and extracellularly surrounding labeled CT terminal SF and boutons in the nst neuronal profiles adjacent to these labeled SF were stained less intensely whereas most nonadjacent profiles were unstained the location of IF is consistent with the secretion of ache into the extracellular space by primary afferent chorda tympani fibers ache staining was reduced in the dextranlabeled CT SF and terminals as well as adjacent nonlabeled profiles weeks following nerve transection and dextran application the CSD of IF outside synapses and the loss of staining following denervation is suggestive of a noncholinergic role for ache in the IN gustatory system

BNC,binucleate cells,TS-4268,while testing for genotoxicity is usually performed on single chemicals SE of humans always comprises a number of genotoxic agents the investigation of potentially synergistic effects of combinations therefore is an important issue in toxicology combinations of kev gammaradiation with the chemical alkylating agent EMS were investigated in the in vitro micronucleus test in mouse lymphoma ly cells with combinations in the low dose linear effect range for the individual agents gy and mm respectively supraadditivity by was seen the synergism was more pronounced at the higher dose C2 supraadditivity was confirmed in experiments using cytochalasin b and analyzing BNC only to control for putative effects on the Tc statistical significance was shown by a FA of variance with interaction the results indicate that damage to dna by gammaradiation and alkylation could affect different rate limiting steps in the formation of micronuclei further investigations will have to show whether the observations are of GA validity in particular whether other endpoints of genotoxicity produce the same results and whether the degree of supraadditivity is always dose dependent the latter would have a strong impact on risk assessment for mixtures at low doses
DCI,delayed cerebral ischemia,TS-4269,DCI dci is a serious and frequent complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage treatments with convincing effect are lacking and the pathophysiology behind dci remains poorly understood NPY-LI npy is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor and a role of npy in the OD of dci has been proposed this T0 investigated the relationship between plasmanpy and cerebral blood flow cbf CVS dci and clinical outcome
CH,calponin homology,TS-4270,nectins are caindependent immunoglobulinlike cellcell adhesion molecules that are involved in formation of cadherinbased adherens junctions ajs the nectinbased cellcell adhesion induces activation of cdc and rac small g proteins which eventually enhances the formation of ajs through reorganization of the actin CSK although evidence has accumulated that nectins recruit cadherins to the nectinbased cellcell adhesion CS through their cytoplasmassociated proteins afadin and catenins it is not fully understood how nectins are physically associated with cadherins here we identified a rat counterpart of the human lim domain only lmo as an afadin and alphaactininbinding protein rat lmo has two splice SCV lmoa and lmob consisting of and amino acids respectively lmo has CH pdz and lim domains WB revealed that lmo was expressed ubiquitously in various rat tissues immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that lmo localized at cellcell ajs where afadin localized in epithelial cells of rat GB in addition lmo localized at the cytoplasmic faces of apical CM in the same epithelial cells we furthermore revealed that lmo bound alphaactinin an actin filamentbundling protein which bound to alphacatenin IP analysis revealed that lmo was associated with both the nectinafadin and ecadherincatenin systems lmo was assembled at the cellcell adhesion CS T3 both the nectinafadin and ecadherincatenin systems had been assembled these results indicate that lmo is an afadin and alphaactininbinding protein that connects the nectinafadin and ecadherincatenin systems through alphaactinin
DMA,dimethylamine,TS-4271,formation of new particles through clustering of molecules from condensable vapors is a significant source for atmospheric aerosols the smallest clusters formed in the very first steps of the condensation process are however not directly observable by exp means we present here a comprehensive series of electronic structure calculations on the hydrates of clusters formed by up to four molecules of sulfuric acid and up to two molecules of ammonia or DMA though clusters containing ammonia and certainly dimethylamine generally exhibit lower average hydration than the pure acid clusters populations of individual hydrates vary widely furthermore we explore the predictions obtained using a thermodynamic model for the description of these hydrates the similar magnitude and trends of hydrate formation predicted by both methods illustrate the potential of combining them to obtain more comprehensive models the stabilization of some clusters relative to others due to their hydration is highly likely to have significant effects on the overall processes that lead to formation of new particles in the atmosphere
ES,epileptic seizures,TS-4272,prolonged ES or se can cause neuronal cell death however the exact role of neuroprotectant against brain injury during epileptic seizure needs to be further elucidated the aim of this T0 was to investigate the expression of the apelin a novel neuroprotective peptide in BB tissues of the patients with TLE tle and exp rats using immunohistochemistry immunofluorescence and WB analysis and to discuss the possible role of apelin in tle thirty temporal neocortical tissue samples from the patients with drugrefractory tle underwent surgical therapy and nine histologically normal temporal lobes tissues as controls were used in our study fiftysix spraguedawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups including one control group and six groups with epilepsy induced by lithiumpilocarpine hippocampus and adjacent SC were taken from the controls and epileptic rats at and days T3 ON of seizures apelin was mainly expressed in the SN of tle patients and controls and was significantly increased in tle patients compared with the controls apelin was also expressed in the neurons of exp and control rats it was gradually increased in the exp rat postseizure and reached a SD high level in chronic epileptic phase our results demonstrated that the increased expression of apelin in the BB may be involved in human tle
SP,side population,TS-4273,the hierarchical tumor propagation or CA stem cells cscs model of carcinogenesis postulates that like physiologic AD stem cell asc the cscs positioned at the apex of any RT population form the crux of RT evolution with a constitutive regenerative capacity and differentiation potential the propagation and recurrence of the characteristically heterogeneous and therapyresistant HCC carcinoma hcc adds to accumulating evidence to support this cscs MM based on the multietiologic basis of hcc formation which among others focuses on the disruption of the canonical wnt signaling pathway this study evaluated the role of cembranetype phytochemical ovatodiolide in the modulation of the wntformula see textcatenin pathway and its subsequent effect on liver cscs activities our fluorescenceactivated cell sorting facs and quantitative rtpcr analyses of SP sp indicated that cd cells were formula see textcateninoverexpressing more aggressive and resistant to the conventional anticancer agents cisplatin and doxorubicin when compared to formula see textcatenindownregulated group we demonstrated that marked upregulation of formula see textcatenin and its downstream targets effectively enhanced hepatosphere formation with an associated induction of cd oct and sox expression and also caused an significant enhancement of hcc proliferation however treatment with ovatodiolide induced downregulation of formula see textcatenin and its downstream effector genes abolished hepatosphere formation and reversed the formula see textcateninassociated enhancement of hcc growth in summary we demonstrated for the first time that ovatodiolide suppressed the canonical wnt signaling pathway and inhibited the generation of CL cscs thus projecting ovatodiolide as a putatively ERP therapeutic agent for antihcc target therapy
CER,costeffectiveness ratio,TS-4274,since the effectiveness of gabexate mesilate in patients with acute one is controversial a metaanalysis of the published literature was conducted to address this problem five randomized trials were identified by our literature search three end points mortality complications and complications requiring surgery were evaluated the results of our metaanalysis indicate that the treatment with gabexate mesilate does not affect mortality at days p but significantly reduces the incidence of complications requiring surgery odds ratio ci p and of complications in GA odds ratio ci p because the drug proves to be beneficial only to a low proportion of the treated patients its clinical impact seems to be small a pharmacoeconomic evaluation shows that its use in all patients with AP would imply a very high cost for preventing each complication the administration of the drug to select patients who are at higher risk of complications could have a better CER however TPS studies on this point are still lacking
SE,secondary electron,TS-4275,the feasibility of the renal epithelial llcpk cell line as a model for cell division studies with SIMS sims was tested in this cell L1 cells undergoing all stages of mitosis and cytokinesis remained firmly attached to the ATP and could be cryogenically prepared fractured FD MI cells showed wellpreserved organelles as revealed by fluorescence imaging of rhodamine and cnbdceramide by CLSM SE microscopy analysis of fractured FD dividing cells revealed minimal surface topography that does not interfere in isotopic imaging of both positive k na mg ca etc and negative p cl etc secondaries with a cameca imsf ion microscope mitotic cells revealed wellpreserved intracellular ionic composition of even the most diffusible ions total concentrations of k and na as revealed by k na ratios of approximately structurally damaged mitotic cells could be identified by their reduced k na ratios and an excessive loading of calcium quantitative threedimensional sims analysis was required for studying subcellular calcium distribution in dividing cells the llcpk MM also allowed sims studies of mphase arrested cells with mitosisarresting drugs taxol monastrol and nocodazole this study opens new avenues of cell division research related to ion fluxes and chemical composition with sims
AC,attenuation correction,TS-4276,if the ct scan of a combined petct study is performed as a full diagnostic quality ct scan including intravenous iv contrast agent the SQ of the joint petct procedure is improved and a separate diagnostic ct scan can be avoided ct with iv contrast can be used for pet AC but this may result in a bias in the attenuation factors the clinical significance of this bias has not been established our aim was to perform a prospective clinical T0 where each patient had ct performed with and without iv UCA to establish whether petct with iv contrast can be used for pet attenuation without reducing the clinical value of the pet scan

SG,specific gravity,TS-4278,correlated responses in reproductive and carcass traits were studied in litters and pigs from a line of landrace pigs selected six generations for increased weight at d of age and a contemporaneous randomly selected control line the reproductive and maternal traits studied included litter sizes born NBA and alive at d and litter weight at birth and at d carcass traits studied were carcass length LMA average backfat thickness thrib BF thickness SG weights of closely trimmed ham loin and shoulder belly weight subjective scoring of the longissimus muscle for color and marbling estimated percentage of muscle and lean gain per day total weighted cumulative selection differential for d weight was kg the realized heritability for d weight was and the change in d weight was kg per generation the regression coefficient of litter size at d on generation was p less than pigs per generation none of the other regression coefficients for the reproductive traits differed from zero carcass length SG and ham weight decreased p less than cm and kg respectively per generation color score and lean gain per day increased points and kgd respectively each generation in response to the selectionabstract truncated at words
DCP,dicalcium phosphate,TS-4279,the hydroxyapatite hap with variable chemical substitutions has been considered as the major component in the mineralized part of bones various metastable crystalline phases have been suggested as transitory precursors of hap in bone but there are no consensuses as to the nature of these phases and their temporal evolution in the present study we cultured rat calvarial OBs with ascorbate and Î²glycerophosphate to explore which calcium phosphate F0 phases comprise the initial mineral in the process of osteoblast mineralization in vitro at the indicated time points the deposited calcium phosphate was analyzed after removing organic substances from the EM with hydrazine the features comparable to DCP dihydrate dcpd and OCP ocp in addition to hap were detected in the mineral phases by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and there was a trend of conversion from dcpd and ocplike phases to hap in the course of mineralization as indicated by fouriertransform infrared microspectroscopy EDX spectroscopy and synchrotron xray powder diffraction analyses besides PSA CA showed a progressive decrease in the ratio of mineralassociated proteins to calcium with time these findings suggest that dcpd and ocplike phases are likely to occur on the course of osteoblast mineralization and the mineralassociated proteins might be involved in modulating the mineral phase transformation
SA,sinus arrhythmia,TS-4280,the results of studies on the effect of betaadrenergic blockade on respiratory SA rsa are discordant in some studies in which an increased rsa was reported central vagotonic activity has been proposed the aim of this study was to verify whether chronic betaadrenergic blockade is capable of increasing rsa and therefore vagal outflow and to analyze whether the mechanism of action is central or peripheral twenty normal subjects mean age years were randomized to receive a hydrophilic nadolol n a lipophilic MET m betablocker and placebo pl after week of therapy a spectral analysis was made of the variability in heart rate and systolic blood pressure sbp while they controlled their breathing at breathsmin for a period of min the high frequency component was calculated for the rr interval hfrr rsa measure and sbp hfsbp and the squared coherence k and phase functions phi hf were assessed between rr and sbp fluctuations in the respiratory band rrsbp a negative phi hf means that rr changes follow sbp changes the alpha hf an index of the baroreflex gain was also calculated both betablockers increased the mean rr interval pl n m ms p hfrr pl n m lnms p and alpha hf pl n m msmmhg p and both modified phi hf pl n m s p no difference was found between n and m chronic betaadrenergic blockade enhanced rsa and baroreflex gain and reduced the phase between the rr interval and sbp oscillations since no difference was found between the hydrophilic and the lipophilic betablockers these changes seem to be due to a peripheral effect
AOD,antioxidative defense,TS-4281,this study offers first hand information on the arsenite asiii and arsenate asvinduced oxidative stress and changes in AOD system of anabaena doliolum a requirement of mm asv as compared to only mm asiii to cause reduction in growth rate suggests that asiii is more toxic than asv in the test cyanobacterium in contrast to above oxidative damage measured in terms of lipid peroxidation electrolyte leakage and peroxide content were significantly higher T3 asv than asiii treatment as compared to control similarly all the studied enzymatic parameters of AOD system except glutathione reductase gr and nonenzymatic parameters except glutathione reduced gsh showed greater induction against asv than asiii interestingly higher increase in nonenzymatic counterpart than enzymatic in both the stresses suggests that detoxification is mainly managed by former than the later this confirms the belief of pronounced stimulation of the AOD system by asv than asiii in conclusion the cyanobacterium may survive better in asv than asiii contaminated fields because of its low toxicity and pronounced induction of antioxidative defense system
CRF,cardiorespiratory fitness,TS-4282,several studies have simultaneously examined PCS activity pa and CRF crf with metabolic syndrome ms however the independent roles of both pa and crf with ms are less firmly established the combined contributions of pa and crf with ms are less studied particularly among chinese women there is uncertainty over the extent to which metabolically healthy but overweightobese individuals have a higher crf level
MSA,multiple sequence alignment,TS-4283,a phylogeny is the evolutionary PH of a group of organisms to date sequence data is still the most used data type for phylogenetic reconstruction before any sequences can be used for phylogeny reconstruction they must be aligned and the SQ of the MSA has been shown to affect the quality of the inferred phylogeny at the same time all the current MSA programs use a guide tree to produce the alignment and experiments showed that good guide trees can significantly improve the multiple alignment quality
BP,brachial plexus,TS-4284,hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies hnpp also called tomaculous neuropathy is an autosomaldominant disorder that produces a painless episodic recurrent focal demyelinating neuropathy hnpp generally develops during adolescence and may cause attacks of numbness muscular weakness and atrophy peroneal palsies carpal tunnel syndrome and other entrapment neuropathies may be frequent manifestations of hnpp motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities may be reduced in clinically affected patients as well as in asymptomatic gene carriers the histopathological changes observed in peripheral SN of hnpp patients include segmental demyelination and tomaculous or sausagelike formations mild overlap of clinical features with charcotmarietooth cmt disease type cmt may lead patients with hnpp to be misdiagnosed as having cmt hnpp and cmt are both demyelinating neuropathies however their clinical pathological and EP features are quite distinct hnpp is most frequently associated with a mb pair deletion on chromosome p a duplication of the identical region leads to cmta both hnpp and cmta result from a dosage effect of the pmp gene which is contained within the deletedduplicated region this is reflected in reduced mrna and protein C2 in SN biopsy samples from hnpp patients treatment for hnpp consists of preventative and symptomeasing measures HNA hna also called familial BP neuropathy is an autosomaldominant disorder causing episodes of paralysis and muscle weakness initiated by severe pain individuals with hna may suffer repeated episodes of intense pain paralysis and sensory disturbances in an affected limb the onset of hna is at birth or later in childhood with prognosis for recovery usually favorable however persons with hna may have permanent residual neurological dysfunction following attacks episodes are often triggered by infections immunizations the puerperium and AS EP studies show normal or mildly prolonged motor nerve conduction E/A distal to the affected brachial plexus pathological studies have found axonal degeneration in nerves examined distal to the plexus abnormality in some hna pedigrees there are characteristic facial features including hypotelorism the prognosis for recovery of normal CF of affected limbs in hna is good although recurrent episodes may cause residual deficits hna is genetically linked to chromosome q where mutations in the septin sept gene have been found
SA,sleep apnoea,TS-4285,patients with obstructive SA complain of excessive daytime sleepiness and unwanted sleep attacks treatment with nasal CPAP cpap normalizes the sleep DP and the daytime symptoms disappear twentyfive patients evaluated their situation by questionnaire before and during cpap treatment treatment improved their working capacity and their social life almost all patients report treatment as giving them a new life ie vastly improving their quality of life cpap treatment is cheap
FC,fecal coliform,TS-4286,anaerobic digestion ad has been proven to be an ERP process for the treatment of wastewater sludge however it produces high C2 of ammonia in the digester effluent which may jeopardize meeting stringent nutrient discharge limits in this T0 the effect of a sequential anaerobicaerobic anaero digestion and a singlestage conventional an digestion as control was investigated on mixed primary AA sludge generated by the annacis island wastewater treatment plant wwtp bc canada an overall sludge retention time srt of days under three different scenarios was chosen based on the current operational srt of the digesters at the annacis island wwtp the Css results have shown that sequential anaero digestion configurations achieved up to higher VS vs removal and lower ammonia generation over singlestage conventional an digestion furthermore sequential anaero system also showed enhanced dewaterability improved FC destruction and reduced digested cake odors over control digesters
NF,nonfailing,TS-4287,angiotensin ii ang ii and endothelin et share their effects on growth of myocardial cells but have been shown to elicit different effects on myocardial CF however these effects vary markedly among species cardiac regions atrium or ventricle and failing or NF myocardium we therefore investigated the effects of both MMP on contractile function of isolated human myocytes from failing and NF hearts
GEM,gemfibrozil,TS-4288,we studied the effects of gemfibrozil on glucose and fatty acid metabolism in subjects with mild endogenous hypertriglyceridemia twenty subjects serum triglycerides mmoll age years body mass index kgm were randomly allocated to receive either PL or gemfibrozil mg daily for weeks in a doubleblind T0 GEM decreased serum total and verylowdensity lipoprotein vldl triglycerides by and respectively and SS apolipoprotein apo b concentration by gemfibrozil had no effect on the diurnal concentration of free fatty acids ffa neither did gemfibrozil NC diurnal blood gl or SS insulin concentrations the EGP rate remained unchanged in both CG during the treatment period and was similarly suppressed by hyperinsulinemia the rate of insulininduced wholebody Rd increased similarly both before basal lowdose insulin and highdose insulin mumolkgmin and T3 and respectively gemfibrozil treatment rates of oxidative and nonoxidative glucose metabolism remained unchanged during GEM treatment basal pretreatment and posttreatment ffa TR were similar in both T0 CG as were the rates of ATP oxidation in summary GEM proved to be an effective SS triglyceridelowering agent in patients with mild hypertriglyceridemia but had no effect on the insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism or of antilipolysis these data support the idea that triglycerides per se do not cause insulin resistance and that the triglyceridelowering effect of gemfibrozil is not mediated via antilipolytic action
AR,acute allograft rejection,TS-4289,rapamycin rapa a recently introduced IS drug seems to be effective in preventing AR although its antiproliferative effect on t lymphocytes has been investigated extensively its effect on the initiators of the immune response the dendritic cells dcs is not known therefore the effect of rapa on monocyte modcs and cdderived dcs in vitro but also on other myeloid cell types including monocytes and macrophages was examined the present study shows that rapa does not affect phenotypic differentiation and cdlinduced maturation of modcs however rapa dramatically reduced cell recovery relatively low concentrations of rapa m induced apoptosis in both modcs and cdderived dcs as visualized by phosphatidylserine exposure nuclear condensation and fragmentation and dna degradation in contrast rapa did not affect freshly isolated monocytes macrophages or myeloid cell lines the sensitivity to rapainduced apoptosis was acquired from day onward of modc differentiation rapa exerts its AI effect via a reversible binding to the cytosolic receptor protein fkbp as demonstrated in competition experiments with fk which is structurally related to rapa partial inhibition of rapainduced apoptosis was obtained by addition of zvadfmk which implies caspasedependent and caspaseindependent processes the fact that rapa exerts a specific effect on dcs but not on monocytes and macrophages might contribute to the unique actions of rapa in the prevention of allograft rejection and other immune responses
HR,hypersensitive reaction,TS-4290,the effect of resistant gene lr on the OD of brown rust fungus puccinia triticina in the immune L1 of thatcher variety was similar to that of nonhost species the OD of the fungus was inhibited in the plant tissue at the early stages the fungus cells demonstrated structural disorganization of the nuclei and mitochondria before host cell invasion the plant cell membranes and chloroplasts were changed large chromatin aggregates appeared in their nuclei HR developed T3 inhibition of the fungus
TE,tracheal epithelial,TS-4291,the adenosine receptor subtype mediating adenosine cyclic monophosphate cAMP formation and the effect of its activation on endothelin et secretion were studied in primary cultures of TE cells adenosine analogues showed the following rank order of potency pd value and alpha on the generation of cyclic amp by TE cells nethylcarboxyamidoadenosine neca aaaab pd adenosine ado non selective pd of neca response cladenosine cado non selective pd of neca responsecgs aa inactive at up to microm cyclic amp formation stimulated by neca in guineapig TE cells was inhibited by adenosine receptor antagonist with the following order of apparent affinity pa value xanthine amine congeners xac aaab cgs aaab zm aa dpcpx a npropylxanthine weak ab this rank order of potency is typical for abadenosine receptor adenosine decreased basal and lpsstimulated iret production in a concentrationdependent manner moreover neca but not cgs inhibited lpsinduced iret production the inhibitory effect of neca on lpsinduced iret production was reversed by xac pa and dpcpx pa these results suggested that adenosine increased cAMP formation and inhibited iret productionsecretion by guineapig tracheal epithelial cells through the activation of a functional adenosine receptor that is most likely the ab AT1 this adenosine receptor may be involved in tnude mice as well as a mu renal carcinoma and its metastases in a syngeneic orthotopic MM histological examination of PT revealed inhibition of microvessel formation in the interior of the RT ptkzk is very well tolerated and does not impair wound healing it also does not have any significant effects on circulating blood cells or bone marrow WBCs as a single agent or impair hematopoetic recovery T3 concomitant cytotoxic anticancer agent challenge this novel compound has therapeutic potential for the treatment of ST and other diseases where angiogenesis plays an important role
TR,turnover rates,TS-4292,turnover among hospital nurses has traditionally been explained in terms of personal attributes of the nurse and extrinsic rewards such as pay and fringe benefits however turnover and its determinants may be viewed in the context of a structural MM operating primarily at the level of the hospital patient care unit four sets of organizational variables were analyzed to assess their independent and combined effects on nursing TR in hospitals
ES,epileptic seizures,TS-4293,ES of focal origin often occur unpredictably as do interictal spikes it is often assumed that spikes increase prior to seizures of focal origin and that antiepileptic medication affects spikes and seizures in a parallel fashion MICs were tumorcellrestricted melanoma and astrocytoma cells were equally susceptible but nonneoplastic glial cells were not affected examination of mo tnf alpha secretion and mrna expression indicated that patient activity was comparable to or greater than normal these results demonstrate that despite steroid therapy circulating monocytes in astrocytoma and other brain RT patients retain intact functional activity
PD,proximaldistal,TS-4294,regeneration of lost body parts has traditionally been seen as a redeployment of embryonic OD however whether regeneration and embryonic OD are controlled by identical similar or different genetic programmes has not been fully tested here we analyse PD regeneration in drosophila leg imaginal discs using the expression of positional markers and by celllineage experiments and we compare it with the pattern already known in normal development during regeneration the first PD positional markers reappear in overlapping patterns as the regenerate expands they segregate and further markers appear until the normal DP is produced following a PT to distal sequence that is in fact the reverse of normal leg imaginal disc OD the results of lineage tracing support this interpretation and show that regenerated structures derive from cells near the wound edge although leg development and leg regeneration are served by a set of MZ genes the ways their PD patterns are achieved are distinct from each other such differences can result from similar developmental gene interactions acting under different starting conditions
CAP,artery pressure,TS-4295,adenosine an intermediate product in the metabolism of atp is thought to produce vasodilation in all vascular beds with the exception of the kidney due to its theoretical potential as a pulmonary vasodilator we studied the hemodynamic effects of adenosine in the pulmonary vasculature of chronically instrumented awake sheep adenosine produced significant pulmonary vasoconstriction instead of the expected vasodilatation bolus injections of adenosine into the superior VC produced a dosedependent increase in pulmonary CAP that was entirely due to an increase in vascular resistance since cardiac SO decreased slightly this effect is produced via activation of TPS cell surface adenosine receptors since it was blocked by the adenosinereceptor antagonists theophylline and dipropylsulfophenylxanthine the cell type involved in adenosineinduced pulmonary vasoconstriction appears to be located within the lung since vasoconstriction was blunted when adenosine was infused into the LA distal to the lung however adenosine does not directly vasoconstrict the pulmonary vasculature because its effect could be CR abolished by cyclooxygenase inhibition with either indomethacin or ibuprofen and by a thromboxane aprostaglandin endoperoxidereceptor antagonist sq adenosineinduced vasoconstriction was also greatly reduced after inhibition of thromboxane synthesis thus adenosine produced pulmonary vasoconstriction through generation of a thromboxaneendoperoxide product whether endogenous adenosine is involved in the generation of pulmonary vasoconstriction seen in pathophysiological states remains to be determined to our knowledge this is the first clear evidence for adenosineinduced vasoconstriction outside the kidney and for an interaction between adenosine and eicosanoid mechanisms
IC,inferior cardiac,TS-4296,all outcome studies of child and adolescent residential treatment and inpatient psychiatric hospitalization reported in the literature from to the present were examined a set of statistical procedures was developed to integrate the findings of the studies whicnds the different SN of the pyloric filter do not exhibit the same sensitivity to the suppressive effects of ps with the lp neuron being the most CS tonic discharge in ps induces graded alterations in the pyloric DP depending on its firing frequency at low less than hz discharge frequencies ps provokes changes in phase relationships and duration of bursting in pyloric SN a slight increase in ps frequency suppresses the rhythmic activity of some pyloric neurons resulting in a switch from a triphasic to a biphasic pattern at higher greater than hz ps firing frequencies rhythmic activity in all the pyloric neurons including the pacemakers pd AB is abolished except in cells VD IC controlling the pyloric valve we conclude that a CPG is not only subject to activating modulatory control but may also be the target of suppressive inputs that are themselves able to provoke functional reconfigurations of the network
PI,porcine insulin,TS-4297,BI had a strong negative effect on the CTX of tetrahymena at the first encounter with the hormone the crystalline PI proved to be neutral while the amorphous PI had a significant positive chemotactic effect at the second encounter with the hormone the presence of imprinting was detectable with BI and induced a significant positive CTX the chemotactic effect of amorphous porcine insulin was depressed while crystalline porcine insulin expressed the most significant positive chemotactic effect in the binding of hormones there was unambiguous positive imprinting independently from the species specificity and from the physicochemical condition of the insulins tetrahymena discriminated at both the first and second encounters between the bovine and porcine insulins which differed in two amino acids the imprinter capacity evident in IB was independent of the chemotactic preference and the imprinting embodied in CTX
CE,crude extract,TS-4298,a bacterial CS ssz isolated from a eutrophic lake in saudi arabia dominated by cyanobacterial blooms showed an antialgal activity against cyanobacteria species based on the analysis of the s rdna gene CS the isolated CS ssz most likely belonged to the genus bacillus with a similarity to bacillus flexus strain emga the thin SL chromatography tlc analysis of the ethyl acetate extract of this bacterium revealed that this strain can produce harmine and norharmane compared to different Î²carboline analog standards harmine and norharmane were also detected in considerable amounts in bacterial GM indicating a potential excretion of these compounds into the aquatic environment the CE of bacillus flexus as well as pure materials of harmine and norharmane inhibited the growth of tested species of cyanobacteria however the bacterial CE has a higher toxicity against tested species of cyanobacteria than harmine and norharmane in addition harmine was more toxic to cyanobacteria than norharmane on the other hand neither pure EDC of harmine and norharmane nor crude bacterial extract showed any antialgal activity against tested species of green algae the results of the present T0 suggest that b flexus ssz or its CE containing harmine and norharmane could be a candidate for the selective control of cyanobacterial blooms without affecting other algal species
TLS,translesion dna synthesis,TS-4299,living organisms are continually under attack from a vast array of dnadamaging agents that imperils their genomic integrity as a consequence cells possess an army of enzymes to repair their damaged chromosomes however dna lesions often persist and pose a considerable threat to survival because they can block the cells replicase and its ability to CR genome duplication it has been clear for many years that cells must possess a mechanism whereby the dna lesion could be tolerated and physically bypassed yet it was only within the past decade that specialized dna polymerases for TLS or tls were identified and characterized many of the tls enzymes belong to the recently described yfamily of dna polymerases by possessing a spacious preformed AS site these enzymes can physically accommodate a variety of dna lesions and facilitate their bypass flexible dnabinding domains and a variable IB pocket for the replicating base pair further allow these tls polymerases to select TPS lesions to bypass and favor distinct nonwatsoncrick base pairs consequently tls polymerases tend to exhibit much lower fidelity than the cells replicase when copying normal dna which results in a dramatic increase in mutagenesis occasionally this can be beneficial but it often speeds the onset of cancer in humans cells use both transcriptional and posttranslational regulation to keep these lowfidelity polymerases under strict control and limit their access to a replication fork our perspective focuses on the mechanistic insights into tls by the yfamily polymerases how they are regulated and their effects on genomic instability that have been described in the past decade
TI,thalassemia intermedia,TS-4300,in two american black families with betathalassemia globin chain synthesis was investigated in vitro the resultant alphabeta and alphanonalpha labelling ratios were expressed in terms of both specific activity and total counts in one family two brothers with clinical presentations compatible with TI had apparently each inherited two different betathalassemia alleles thus they are compound heterozygotes their alphabeta or alphanonalpha ratios were in the same range as those found in caucasian subjects with severe cooleys anemia in addition alphabeta ratios in heterozygotes in this T0 were the same as those found in caucasian heterozygotes a difference in degree of chain imbalance measured by our present method cannot explain the relative lack of severe clinical manifestations of thal in blacks further family studies are indicated to discover other genetic or environmental factors modifying the effects of thal
SA,substance abuse,TS-4301,this chapter addresses key department of transportation dot rules for drug testing employees working in industries regulated by the dot it also discusses the issue of SA and the ADA finally it reviews the iss e of confidentiality it is important for the reader to recognize that this chapter is but a review of critical and crucial material the reader is encouraged to pursue additional information if greater clarity and understanding are required
SA,sleep apnoea,TS-4302,inherited traits of obstructive SA osa may have link to the heritability of the airway anatomy the aim of this T0 was to investigate heritability of the airway anatomy by comparing skeletal and soft tissue features of korean MZ mz and dizygotic twins dz in total participants mean age Â± years males females including mz pairs and dz pairs with same sex were participated the craniofacial craniovertebral hyoideal and pharyngeal parameters were measured using lateral cephalograms the genetic analysis was performed using falconers method high heritability was detected in the hyoid position and inclination of the cervical column the VP and hypopharyngeal dimensions showed higher heritability compared to those of the NP and oropharynx the body mass index bmi had interactions with the nasopharyngeal and hypopharyngeal dimensions and length of the tongue and soft palate the mandibular growth had correlations with the nasopharyngeal and hypopharyngeal dimensions the vertical skeletal relationships appeared to have interaction with the nasopharyngeal velopharyngeal and hypopharyngeal dimensions as well as length of the tongue and soft palate a forwarded inclination of the cervical columns was seen in connections with bmi and the NP and hypopharyngeal dimensions the airway structures and head postures seemed to be under strong genetic controls the airway dimensions had associations with bmi head postures and skeletal structures which showed high heritability forwarded head postures would be physiological adaptations of compromised airway adequacy by increased bmi and retrognathia
AI,apoptotic,TS-4303,dna damage can lead to either dna repair with cell survival or to AI cell death although the biochemical processes underlying dna repair and apoptosis have been extensively studied the mechanisms by which cells determine whether the damage will be repaired or the AI pathway will be activated is largely unknown we have studied the role of nucleotide excision repair ner in cisplatin dna damageinduced apoptotic cell death using both normal human fibroblasts and nerdefective xeroderma pigmentosum xp xpa and xpg cells the ICE activation experiment demonstrated a greatly increased casapse activation in the nerdefective cells following cisplatin treatment the flow cytometry experiment revealed an altered cell cycle arrest DP of the nerdefective cells following cisplatin treatment the results obtained from the western blot experiment showed that ner defects resulted in enhanced chk phosphorylation and p induction T3 cisplatin treatment the cisplatin treatmentinduced atm phosphorylation however was attenuated in nerdefective cells the results obtained from our IP experiment further demonstrated that the atm protein interacted with the tfiih basal transcription factor and the xpg protein of the ner pathway it also showed that a functional xpc protein was required for the association of the atm protein to genomic dna these results suggest that the ner process may prevent the cisplatin treatmentinduced apoptosis by activating the atm protein and that the presence of the xpc protein is essential for recruiting the atm protein to the dna template
DA,diagnostic accuracy,TS-4304,we have analyzed the preoperative diagnosis of cholesteatoma through the use of diffusionweighted intensity magnetic resonance dwimr in consecutive patients suffering from chronic OM with clinical and radiological by computed tomography suspicion of cholesteatoma in particular we compared the radiological data with intraoperative ones verifying the correspondence in terms of sensitivity specificity positive predictive value negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy between what is reported by dwimr and what is actually detectable at the time of surgery furthermore we identified the most reliable dwimr sequence singleshot ssh echo planar imaging epi vs multishot turbo spinecho notepi to detect cholesteatoma and reduce the time for examination the obtained data on computed tomography scans revealed low DA dwimr instead showed higher values especially using notepi sequences vs obtained by sshepi sequences
NS,neck suction,TS-4305,central autonomic control on the cardiovascular system has been widely investigated in the last decades more recently with the advent of BB imaging techniques considerable effort is being spent on defining the role of TPS brain areas and their dynamic network acting on autonomic efferents a way to assess autonomic modulation is offered by carotid stimulation in this work we propose a methodology to investigate autonomic control in carotid stimulation experiments using heartbeat series in combination with fmri imaging we modeled cardiovascular signals using the point process model and processed fmri data in order to estimate independent components of correlated information using crosscorrelation and surrogate analysis we assessed the responsiveness of subjects to NS stimuli and identified stimulusrelated fmri independent components
HS,bedtime,TS-4306,the pharmacology pharmacokinetics clinical efficacy contraindications and precautions adverse effects dosage and cost of misoprostol are reviewed misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of NK prostaglandin e it produces a doserelated inhibition of gastric acid and pepsin secretion and enhances mucosal resistance to injury misoprostol is extensively absorbed from the stomach and undergoes rapid deesterification to its biologically AS metabolite misoprostol acid the average absorption after an oral dose is Tmax of misoprostol acid are achieved in less than minutes PCTs have demonstrated ulcer healing rates of approximately in patients with DUs who received misoprostol micrograms daily for four weeks misoprostol was generally no more efficacious than conventional therapy with the hreceptor antagonists cimetidine and RAN the healing rate observed for gastric ulcers was less than that observed for duodenal ulcers in trials involving healthy volunteers and patients with arthritis receiving aspirin naproxen tolmetin ibuprofen or piroxicam misoprostol was consistently superior to placebo cimetidine and sucralfate in the prevention of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaidinduced gastropathy the majority of these studies have been of short duration however LT studies up to three months have corroborated superiority over placebo misoprostol is an abortifacient and is contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential not using ERP contraception the most common adverse effect of misoprostol therapy is diarrhea which is often mild and selflimiting and can be minimized by administration of misoprostol after meals and at HS the cost based on retail price of four weeks of therapy with misoprostol is comparable to that of other antiulcer agents misoprostol has been shown to be an ERP agent for the prevention of nsaidinduced gastric ulcers however there is no evidence that it offers any clinical advantage over hreceptor antagonists for the treatment of gastric or DU
SOC,shamoperated control,TS-4307,ischemic preconditioning has been established as a powerful exp neuroprotective strategy both T3 global and focal CBF ischemia little is known however about the structural and PET longterm outcome therefore our present T0 was designed to check for potential subtle alterations in the hippocampus after longterm survival gerbils were subjected either to shortterm ischemia of min duration usually used for ischemic preconditioning n or to sham operation n and allowed to survive for weeks hippocampi with neuronal densities comparable to those of SOC animals were analyzed for dendritic marker proteins map mapb and synaptopodin respectively although map immunoreactivity was widely unchanged in all hippocampal subfields both mapb and synaptopodin protein expression was decreased to about to of sham controls a significant reduction however was only seen for synaptopodin immunoreactivity in SO and pyramidale of HPC ca subfield in conclusion our data indicate a dissociation of neuronal survival and dendritic integrity weeks after shortterm ischemia usually used for ICM preconditioning analysis of postischemic synaptopodin protein expression is the most CS method to detect subtle dendritic changes compared to the classical dendritic marker molecules map and mapb
LC,locus ceruleus,TS-4308,to study the role of LC in maintaining the bloodbrain barrier function in conditions of emotional stress the bloodbrain barrier permeability was estimated after LC damaging with dsp nchloroethylnethylbromobenzylamine the importance of locus ceruleus for the integrity of bloodbrain barrier functions in control animals and especially in rats exposed to emotional AS was revealed the data obtained prove the homeostatic role of LC which is the most prominent in conditions of emotional AS
VC,vehicle control,TS-4309,gammahydroxybutyrate ghb satisfies many of the criteria for consideration as a neurotransmitter including having specific receptor sites endogenous synthesis and heterogeneous cns CSD ghb has been reported to be illicitly used to induce physical dependence and to relieve effects from alcohol and heroin withdrawal ghb has also been shown to have antidopaminergic activity to displace hmk IB in brain membranes and to have some in vivo effects similar to the typical antipsychotics to characterize the behavioral pharmacology of ghb further we evaluated it for its reinforcing effects upon iv administration in rhesus monkeys with pcp selfadministration histories its ability to produce heroin and pcplike discriminative CS- effects and for its ability to antagonize cocaine discrimination in rats the results indicated that ghb microgramskg per infusion was not selfadministered above VC rates although selfinfusions occurred at C2 sufficient to produce signs indicative of sedation also neither heroin nor pcp discriminative CS- effects generalized to i.v. of ghb up to mgkg ip and ghb did not effectively antagonize the cocaine discriminative CS- when tested up to mgkg ip these data indicate that ghb is unlike pcp as a reinforcer and that neither pcp nor heroin generalize to i.v. of ghb nor can injections of ghb attenuate the discriminative CS- effects of cocaine
GC,golgi complex,TS-4310,the structure of the intraglandular SMG is described in both postnatal and adult rats the ganglion is localised mainly at the hilum where the majority of the cell HB are observed ganglia are also present in the intralobular septa of both the SM and the SL PG often they are found along the main salivary ducts with the larger ganglia being encapsulated by connective tissue on electron microscopy the SMG cells show the usual features of autonomic neurons the cells contain a prominent round nucleus numerous short processes project from the soma together with a few long dendrites the organelles are randomly distributed throughout the soma most of the synapses observed were on the short processes with occasional axosomatic synapses nonsynaptic desmosomelike contacts are a common feature among the ganglion cells especially noteworthy are contacts made by the dendrites which deeply invaginate the soma of an adjacent nerve cell the ganglion cells of the postnatal and AD submandibular ganglia show minor differences ultrastructurally the postnatal cells show signs of immaturity such as abundant free ribosomes well developed golgi complexes and disorganised RER mitotic satellite cells were observed associated with the postnatal GCs the study has confirmed that all the SM ganglion cells show a positive reaction for acetylcholinesterase CEA is localised in the cisternae of RER the GC plasma membrane and nuclear envelope
PN,pulp necrosis,TS-4311,dens invaginatus is a malformation of teeth probably resulting from an infolding of the dental papilla during tooth OD affected teeth show a deep infolding of enamel and dentine starting from the foramen coecum or even the tip of the cusps and which may extend deep into the root teeth most affected are maxillary lateral incisors and bilateral occurrence is not uncommon the malformation shows a broad spectrum of morphologic variations and frequently results in early PN root canal therapy may present severe problems because of the complex anatomy of the teeth aetiology prevalence classification and therapeutic considerations including root canal therapy apical surgery and prevention of pulpal involvement are reviewed
IR,incomplete repair,TS-4312,mixture models are proposed for simultaneous analysis of the RL and fractionation characteristics of radiation injury in lateresponding normal tissues the method is an extension of the direct analysis for quantal response data conceptually the application of the mixture model is based on the biological observation that over a wide range of doses a proportion of the irradiated subjects will never express damage mixture models allow the time of occurrence to be utilized in the analysis furthermore this type of MM takes timecensored observations into account in a natural way and provides an adequate FR for modelling and analysis of effectdependent RL mixture models with complete and IR are applied to doseincidence data for four late endpoints in rodents death from radiationinduced pneumonitis leg paralysis after spinalcord irradiation and radiationinduced rectal stenosis and anal discharge radiationinduced pneumonitis had an effectdependent latency the modelling of this phenomenon correlates well with the results of histologic studies interestingly the ratio of hazard rates was not constant for this endpoint the dominating feature in the RL of radiation injury to the spinal cord was a strong dependency on dose per fraction after correction for this effect a tendency towards a longer latent time for lower effect levels was observed for the rectal complications there was no difference between RL with radiation only vs radiation combined with cisplatin
LD,under lightdark,TS-4313,we screened circadianregulated genes in rat cartilage by using a dna microarray analysis in rib growthplate cartilage numerous genes showed statistically significant circadian mrna expression under both h lightdark and constant darkness conditions type ii collagen and aggrecan genesalong with several genes essential for posttranslational modifications of collagen and aggrecan including prolyl hydroxylase lysyl oxidase lysyl oxidaselike and PAPS synthase showed the same circadian phase in addition the mrna level of sox a master transcription factor for the synthesis of type ii collagen and aggrecan has a similar phase of circadian rhythms the circadian expression of the matrixrelated genes may be critical in the OD and the growth of various cartilages because similar circadian expression of the matrixrelated genes was observed in hip joint cartilage however the circadian phase of the major matrixrelated genes in the rib permanent cartilage was almost the converse of that in the rib growthplate cartilage LD conditions we also found that half of the oscillating genes had conserved clockregulatory elements indicating contribution of the elements to the clock outputs these findings suggest that the synthesis of the cartilage matrix macromolecules is controlled by cellautonomous clocks depending upon the in vivo location of cartilage
SM,submucosal,TS-4314,endoscopic SM dissection esd of lesions using expanded indications for early gastric CA egc has been acceptedtely prospectively giving patients the most suitable product in advance systematic use of the existing implant concepts can avoid a large number of implantrelated complications ad hoc further OD steps with regard to improved surface modifications can be made more specifically however the hope of a super strategy is likely to remain unfulfilled because bacteria as opponents have already proved billions of years of survival
AD,affective disorders,TS-4315,the function of serotonin transporters serts is related to mood regulation mice with deficient or reduced sert CF sert knockout mice show several behavioral changes including increased anxietylike behavior increased sensitivity to AS and decreases in aggressive behavior some of these behavioral alterations are similar to phenotypes found in humans with short alleles of polymorphism in the hydroxytryptamine ht transporterlinked promoter region httlpr therefore sert KO can be used as a tool to study httlprrelated variations in personality and may be the etiology of affective disorders this article focuses on the cellular and molecular alterations in sert KO including changes in ht concentrations and its metabolism alterations in ht receptors impaired hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal gland axis developmental changes in the SN and brain and influence on other neurotransmitter transporters and receptors it also discusses the possible relationships between these alterations and the behavioral changes in these mice the knowledge provides the foundation for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the sertrelated mood regulation which may have significant impact on understanding the etiology of AD and developing better therapeutic approaches for AD
CCP,chronic calcific pancreatitis,TS-4316,large pancreatic ductal calculi and pain are a feature of CCP ccp in the tropics this C1 single center study evaluates the role of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy eswl in fragmentation of C1 pancreatic stones and relief of pain in patients with ccp
MAT,microscopic agglutination test,TS-4317,antibodies to leptospira interrogans serovars hardjo and pomona were present in and of sera respectively from adult female cattle in alberta surveyed in criterion for a positive SS sample was agglutination at dilution in the MAT a positive herd contained one or more cows with positive SS prevalences were calculated on sample sizes that would give reliability hardjo antibody prevalences and hardjopositive herd prevalences were and respectively among municipalities surveyed pomona prevalences by comparison were and respectively hardjo had increased significantly since and antibodies were found throughout the province pomona occurred mainly in southeastern alberta where it was isolated from cattle swine and skunks hardjo was isolated only from cattle and it was found in many Az antibodies to icterohaemorrhagiae were present in of sera from parts of alberta surveyed in evidence of the presence of leptospires related to this serovar in bovine and porcine urinary tracts was obtained by immunofluorescence
PS,palmazschatz,TS-4318,after placing a stent in the main vessel of a bifurcation lesion it is often necessary to perform further balloon inflation or stent placement through the stent struts in order to treat a lesion of the secondary vessel or side branch this balloon inflation with dilatation through the cells of the stent in the main vessel results in stent strut disfigurement this disfigurement causes various degrees of stenosis within the main vessel secondary to stent strut deformity the degree of strut deformity and therefore stenosis may vary significantly depending on stent design and structure a model of a bifurcation lesion with an angle of degrees was created from acrylic resin the diameters of the main vessel and the secondary vessel were both mm deployment of the palmazschatz stent ps n nir stent n or multilink stent n was performed in the main vessel with a mm balloon catheter inflated to atm a second mm balloon catheter was then inflated to atm through the stent struts of the main vessel and into the ostium of the secondary vessel the MLD mld and crosssectional area csa at the ostium of the side CB and the stenosis within the main vessel were then measured taking into account the stent deformity that occurred kissing balloon dilatation with two mm balloon catheters was then performed and the stenosis AA to stent deformity in the main vessel was remeasured the mld of the multilink stent at the sidebranch ostium was greater compared with those of the PS stent or the nir stent mm p and csa mm p balloon inflation through the stent struts caused stent deformity that resulted in some degree of stenosis within the stent of the main vessel in all three stent types kissing balloon inflation reduced but never eliminated this stenosis the percent stenosis in the main vessel secondary to stent deformity ps nir multilink ns and residual stenosis postkissing balloon inflation ps nir multilink ns were not significantly different among these three stents at the sidebranch ostium the mld and csa were significantly greater for the multilink stent compared with those of the PS or nir stent balloon inflation through the stent struts caused stent deformity that resulted in stenosis within the stent in the main vessel kissing balloon inflation reduced this stenosis but some residual stenosis always remained the stenoses within the main vessel did not differ among the three stent types cathet cardiovasc intervent
CI,cervical incompetence,TS-4319,the introduction of testing for highrisk hpv types and p IS of cin histologic specimens allows for determination of the risk of progression versus regression for a woman with a particular cytologic or histologic specimen observation with serial cytological or colposcopic examinations is now appropriate for women with lowgrade histologic lesions as well as Pr and young women with certain highgrade histologic lesions current recommendations for management of highgrade lesions the efficacy of treatment options cryotherapy and leep and the immediate bleeding infection and longer term complications CI PT delivery of cervical dysplasia treatment are presented
MV,maedivisna,TS-4320,MV virus mvv in sheep which infects mainly cells of the monocytemacrophage lineage produces changes in the lung MG brain and joints in this T0 however the liver and heart of six naturally infected sheep were examined for the presence of the virus mvv proviral dna was demonstrated by PCR reaction pcr analysis and immunohistochemical examination revealed viral antigens in the cytoplasm of HCs and cardiac myocytes although histopathological examination showed mild to moderate chronic lymphocytic cholangiohepatitis and MC and the presence of small lymphoid aggregates the typical maedi lymphoproliferative lesions lymphoid folliclelike structures of considerable size with germinal centres were not seen in the CL and heart these novel findings suggest that although the macrophage is the main cell for productive viral replication the liver and HR represent additional mvv targets
TCA,tricyclic,TS-4321,since its discovery in we now have a wealth of knowledge relating to the biochemical pharmacological and physiological actions of thromboxane a txa and its related metabolites these molecular insights have been greatly expedited by the molecular cloning and characterization of a cdna for the human txa receptor now termed the t prostanoid or tp receptor from a megakaryocyticplacental cdna library in and later through the discovery of a cdnawood within nine scots pine pinus sylvestris provenances seedlings of different provenances representing a km ns transect from estonia to northern finland were cultivated in suonenjoki nursery field CE finland for seven years growth of seedlings and the number of vertical resin ducts in wood were also determined alphapinene and carene were the major monoterpenes both in the needles and wood the total monoterpene concentration was about five times higher in the needles than in the wood a strong positive rho was found between proportional quantities of several terpenes of the needles and wood particularly for carene sabinene and terpinolene the needles contained both labdanetype and TCA resin acids whereas the wood contained only tricyclic ones the wood had a four times higher tricyclic resin acid concentration than the needles the highest total monoterpene concentration in the needles and in the wood occurred in the most northern muonio provenance and in the most southern saaremaa provenance plants respectively the amount of high carene genotype trees decreased among the northern provenances the wood of the most RNA muonio provenance showed the lowest total resin acid concentration but provenance did not affect total tricyclic resin acids in the needles korpilahti provenance trees from CE finland had the best growth in height in addition korpilahti and ruokolahti provenance trees showed largest radial growth of stem and smallest number of vertical resin ducts the results suggest that especially the proportional quantity of carene in the needles could be used in estimating the amount of this compound in the wood and vice versa
AD,atherogenic diet,TS-4322,plasma MDA-LDL cholesterol plasma ldlc VE cells and IP blood MNC cells pbmcs particularly monocytes play key roles in initiating atherosclerosis the primary cause of cardiovascular disease cvd although the mechanisms underlying OD of atherosclerosis are not well understood ldlc is known to influence expression of endothelial micrornas mirnas and genetargets of mirnas to promote cell senescence however the impact of ldlc on expression of pbmc mirnas and mirna targeted genes in response to an AD is not known in this study we used unbiased methods to identify coordinately responsive pbmc mirna gene networks that differ between low and high ldlc baboons when HC highfat hchf diet
HD,hip dysplasia,TS-4323,hip dysplasia has long been known to be a risk factor for pain and degenerative changes in the hip joint the diagnosis of dysplasia has historically been based on assessments of acetabular anatomy on the anteroposterior pelvic radiograph most commonly the lateral centeredge angle recent advances in imaging of the dysplastic hip with computerized tomography scans have demonstrated that HD is in fact a dimensional d deformity of the acetabulum and that multiple patterns of hip instability exist that may not be completely assessed on d imaging a more thorough understanding of acetabular anatomy permits an evolution away from vague terms such as borderline dysplasia a d assessment of the acetabulum and the resultant patterns of instability may be more AGA since this would allow more accurate treatment to correct the strs md of the flavin in complex with its rna aptamer were conducted in solution linked with six thymidines t and finally immobilized on an hexanolthiolfunctionalized gold surface first we demonstrated that our md computations were able to reproduce the exp solution structure and to provide a meaningful estimation of the flavin free energy of IB we also demonstrated that the t linkage by itself does not generate a perturbation of the flavin recognition process from the simulation of the complete biosensor system we observed that the aptamer stays oriented parallel to the surface at a distance around Ã¥ avoiding this way interaction with the surface we evidenced a structural reorganization of the flavin aptamer IB mode related to the loss of affinity and induced by an anisotropic CSD of sodium cationic densities this means that ionic diffusion is different between the surface and the aptamer than above this last one we suggest that these findings might be extrapolated to other nucleic acids systems for the future design of biosensors with higher efficiency and selectivity
PN,phosphoramidate,TS-4324,an CAA deoxyadenosine PN and the corresponding PO congener have been synthesized and tested for primer extension by hiv reverse transcriptase replacement of the PN linkage of lhistidinedamp by a phosphodiester linkage was found to have a beneficial influence on the affinity of this ATP towards hiv reverse transcriptase and on the velocity of the nucleotide incorporation reaction modifications of the nature of the px bond can be useful to finetune the substrate properties of nucleoside triphosphate analogues our results also demonstrate that polymerization pausing observed during the incorporation of leaving group modified dntps is not caused by the nature of the linkage
ADA,americans with disabilities act,TS-4325,though the treatment of diabetes has advanced remarkably the law and many employers have not always kept pace new insulins delivery systems and monitoring systems give people with diabetes exceptional control over their BS and virtually eliminate serious complications such as hypoglycemia and HG changes in the law particularly the ADA and its amendments give people with diabetes greater rights and employment opportunities than ever before despite these advances many employers continue to use blanket bans or illconsidered standards to bar people with diabetes efforts to break down these remaining barriers are ongoing through employee litigation and through the american diabetes associations collaboration with entities that set occupational standards
TF,total fat,TS-4326,few data are available regarding dietary habits of the elderly in particular about fatty acid consumption whereas these are major risk or protective AF of several agerelated diseases the aim of the present study was to characterise the dietary intake of a french elderly population in terms of energy macronutrients and fatty acids based on their sociodemographic characteristics the study population age range years consisted of subjects from bordeaux france included in the threecity cohort dietary assessment was performed by a h recall allowing the estimation of energy protein carbohydrate TF sfa mufa and pufa intakes sociodemographic characteristics age sex marital status educational level and income practice of sports and bmi were registered total SE NI ei was lower in women and in older participants or years but higher in single subjects higher ei was associated with higher income but not with educational level mean contribution of macronutrients to ei protein carbohydrate and total fat was higher in women than men except for alcohol the oldest individuals consumed less protein and more mono and disaccharides excess saturated fat NI of TF associated with a relative deficit in mufa consumption of TF was observed the mean nn ratio was and decreased with higher educational level the present results suggest that being female older age being widowed and low income level could be considered as risk AF of inadequate dietary intake
CAS,coronary artery spasm,TS-4327,ten patients representing per cent of those patients undergoing selective coronary arteriography were found to have unequivocal evidence of PD spasm this involved the proximal RA PD in eight patients the midleft anterior descending CB in one and the left main PD in one eight of these patients had otherwise normal coronary arteries of these patients with CAS nine had evidence of mitral valve prolapse this involved the posteromedial scallop in six patients the AL and posteromedial scallops in one the middle and posteromedial scallops in one and the anterolateral middle and posteromedial scallops in one these data suggest an association between CAS and mitral valve prolapse CAS may thus be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the chest pain arrhythmias electrocardiographic CA and sudden death that have already been described in some patients with MVP
RC,radical cystectomy,TS-4328,we interviewed sexually AS women about sexual function before and T3 RC of the women also had received preoperative irradiation seven women resumed sexual activity all subjects experienced dyspareunia on initial attempts but had overcome the pain at followup to months postoperatively these women were coitally orgasmic and reported no decrease in pleasure or change in the type of sexual stimulation required to produce orgasm the results provide knowledge about the physiology of female orgasm and a basis for counseling patients
HP,protein diet,TS-4329,hepatolithiasis or primary intrahepatic stones are prevalent in the fareast countries such as korea japan and taiwan it has been associated with helminthiasis bacterial infections environmental and dietary AF despite high prevalence of helminthiasis like ascariasis poor environmental condition and low HP india and middleeast countries have a low incidence of hepatolithiasis we report two cases of hepatolithiasis associated with bacterial infections and were surgically managed the first case is a yearold female presenting with upper abdominal pain and fever she had multiple calculi in intrahepatic biliary radicles CBD CHD and gall bladder she was managed by cholecystectomy LL liver sectionectomy choledochoscopy assisted stone clearance of the residual CL and HJ the second case is a yearold female presenting with epigastric pain and fever and past history of cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis she had multiple RA and left intrahepatic calculi and managed by left lateral CL sectionectomy with excision of cbd and RY hepaticojejunostomy both the cases showed growth of bacteria in the SC of the intraoperatively collected bile
CP,chronic pancreatitis,TS-4330,the silver positive cells of the exocrine pancreas and primary pancreatic cancers were studied with the grimelius silver stain and the fontanamasson technique in the pancreas cells containing black granules with the grimelius method which at the same time react negative to fontanamasson are considered argyrophil these cells were present in the basal portion of some of the acinar tissue and in the ductal epithelia as well as in the a cells of islets the incidence and CSD of these argyrophil cells were also studied in a variety of ductal lesions in the socalled ductal proliferation numerous numbers of positive cells were found argyrophil cells were frequently situated in the basal portion of ductal squamous cell metaplasia in goblet cell metaplasia the numbers were few and less than in normal ducts we concluded that the CSD and incidence of argyrophil cells in the ductal epithelia is related to CP and in particular to regenerative processes the incidence of argyrophil cells in primary pancreatic CA excluding islets cell origin was per cases we considered them pancreatic CA with argyrophil cells
MM,mixed micelles,TS-4331,light scattering birefringence and xray studies showed that liposomes with lipid molecules orientated in bilayers are formed from egg licithinlysolecithin mixtures up to mol percent of LL above this concentration much smaller MM are formed permeability studies demonstrated a dramatic increase in the permeability of the liposomes when the lyso concentration exceeds mol percent xray studies indicated a significant decrease in bilayer thickness with increasing lysolecithin concentration it is suggested that decreased interaction eneras CR ERP against the respiratory rate depression produced by combinations of FE and droperidol it is suggested that the duration of the antagonist effects of naloxone are shorter against respiratory depression than against analgesia
SL,stemloop,TS-4332,HIV-1 uses ribosomal frameshifting for translation of the gagpol polyprotein frameshift activities are thought to be tightly regulated analysis of gag p sequences from plasma virions identified in of the samples the occurrence of polymorphism that could lead to changes in thermodynamic stability of the stemloop expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae of pbetagalactosidase F0 proteins from representative natural SL variants and three laboratory mutant constructs predicted the thermodynamic stability delta g degrees ranging from to kcalmol identified a reduction in frameshift activity of to compared with constructs with the wildtype stemloop delta g degrees kcalmol viruses carrying stemloops associated with greater than reductions in frameshift activity presented profound defects in viral replication in contrast viruses with SL structures associated with to reductions in frameshift efficiency displayed no significant viral replication deficit
CP,chronic periodontitis,TS-4333,this aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the formation of volatile sulfur compounds vsc and the severity of different kinds of periodontal disease twenty patients suffering from biofilmrelated periodontal diseases and a control group of ten HI were selected the patients were divided according to their periodontal diagnoses marginal gingivitis mgn and CP cpn the patients received nonsurgical therapy that consisted of motivation SRP two experimental periods were used t baseline and t final evaluation T3 three months the data analysis showed that cp group had a significant reduction p in probing depth pd and clinical attachment level cal and group mg presented a reduction in gi p there was a significant reduction p in the aspartate aminotransferase ast nabenzoyldlargininepnitroanilide bapna and vsc C2 in both mg and cp CG although the deeper residual pockets led to higher ast and vsc C2 in the cp group within the limits of the present pilot study it can be concluded that the nonsurgical therapy may influence vsc formation in a manner dependent on periodontal disease severity
GM,gluteus maximus,TS-4334,we evaluated the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging mri for assessing the response of patients with endometriomas to medical therapy mri was performed before and after treatment in consecutive patients with at least one endometrioma with a maximal diameter mm diagnosed by laparoscopy who received microg of buserelin acetate daily for months patients were categorized as good NR GI n and poor responders group ii n depending on the results of a thirdlook LS performed months T3 treatment we determined the ratio of the signal intensity si of the endometrioma to the si of the GM muscle on tweighted images tsim muscle si and the volume of the endometrium the volume decreased by in of the goodresponse group and of the poorresponse group there was no significant difference between the two CG the tsimsi decreased in of patients in group i but in only one of seven patients in group ii a significant difference p between the two CG in the goodresponse group there was a positive linear rho between the decrease in the volume of the endometrioma and the decrease in the tsimsi T3 treatment r p therefore the tsimsi determined from mr images may be useful in assessing the therapeutic response of patients with endometriomas
FEM,finite element,TS-4335,in view of the growing consensus that traditional cephalometric analyses yield data of dubious scientific validity this T0 was undertaken using an alternative technique termed finite element analysis fea the study was based on triangular finite elements spanning seven datum nodal points delineating cephalometric form these points were delineated on lateral cephalographs taken immediately before and following the completion of orthodontic treatment for two samples of boys aged years although both samples exhibited class i molar occlusions with anterior overcrowding one sample required BL maxillary and mandibular first premolar extraction prior to orthodontic treatment while the other sample did not fea revealed greater cephalometric size and shape changes in the nonextraction than SE samples such sample contrasts however varied depending upon the FEM included in the analysis further studies are therefore required to delineate the TPS finite PE configurations to provide precise descriptions of cephalometric NC
NP,normal prostate,TS-4336,using the differential displaypolymerase chain reaction technique to identify androgenresponsive genes in the human prostatic tumor cell line lncap we cloned an expression tag homologous to the human pseudoautosomal gene mic the role of mic in the prostate had not previously been studied we used a series of cell lines derived from lncap that varied in their degree of differentiation and M1 potential to assess the relationship between mic expression and androgen responsiveness in prostate cancer the expression of mic mrna and its product e was upregulated by androgen in a dose and timedependent manner in the parental lncap line and correlated with the expression of prostatespecific antigen in the lncap sublines and an androgenrepressed invasive PC-3 cancer cell L1 arcap mic gene expression was not regulated by androgen and was associated with poorer differentiation decreased androgen sensitivity and higher metastatic potential immunohistochemical analyses indicated that e was expressed in tissues from patients with primary prostate CA of in fetal prostatic tissues low levels in all fetal tissues assessed and sporadically in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues one of four the NP tissues did not show positive e staining with the exception of one centralzone section from one of the eight NP samples assessed these findings suggest that deregulation of expression of the human pseudoautosomal gene mic occurred in the prostate
VM,ventricular muscle,TS-4337,seven patients with anomalous RA VM bundle are presented to emphasize possible pitfalls in the clinical diagnosis as based on PE chest x ray and electrocardiogram echocardiography on the other hand revealed abnormalities in all four of the patients on whom the study was done the echocardiogram was directly responsible for a change in diagnosis and referral for a cardiac catheterization in one patient who had been followed for years with the clinical diagnosis of a small ventricular septal defect four of the seven patients with anomalous RA VM bundle had extracardiac anomalies one girl with an absent left thumb and three patients one girl and two boys with leftsided renal anomalies this high incidence of renal anomalies has not been previously reported in clinical or postmortem series
BA,bronchial asthma,TS-4338,BA is a chronic inflammatory NMRD that is caused by the complex interaction of environmental influences and genetic susceptibility the first genomewide association T0 of bronchial asthma discovered a significant association between snps within q genomic region and childhood bronchial asthma in individuals of european descent association with this genomic region was then replicated in a number of independent samples of EU and asian descent here we report results of the first genomewide association T0 of BA in the volgaural region of russia the present T0 includes unrelated patients with physiciandiagnosed bronchial asthma and diseasefree control subjects of different ethnic origin russians tatars and bashkirs genotyping of dna samples was carried out using the illumina human quad array as a part of gabriel project contract from the ec no lshbct after qc filtering procedures a final set of snps genotyped in cases and controls was tested for association with bronchial asthma five markers on chromosome q showed statistically significant association with BA p or x snp rs with the strongest evidence for association p x is located within the first intron of the gsdmb gene evidence for association was stronger with childhoodonset asthma p x for snp rs compared to lateonset asthma p x for snp rs our replication T0 using three snps within gsdmb gene confirmed association with only childhoodonset asthma in summary these results suggest an important role for genetic SCV within qq region in the OD of BA in the volgaural region of russia
NIC,nicorandil,TS-4339,chronic diabetes precipitates ischaemic HR disease ihd and many other disorders ihd inturn is shown in the form of angina initially according to europa study the incidence of angina is high in type ii diabetics gliclazide a second generation sulphonylurea derivative is widely used in the treatment of typeii diabetes and is known to PR insulin by k channel inhibition nicorandil a newer antianginal drug widely used now a days acts by opening potassium channels in the cardiac muscle cell and also by releasing nitric oxide however its action on pancreatic cell k channel is not known since there is possibility for drug interaction leading to decreased activity of gliclazide the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of the combination studies in normal and alloxan induced diabetic rats were conducted with oral doses of mgkg bd wt of gliclazide mgkg bd wt of nicorandil and their combination with adequate washout periods in between treatments studies in normal rabbits were conducted with mg kg bd wt of gliclazide mg kg bd wt of NIC and their combination given orally blood samples were collected in rats from retro orbital puncture at and h and by marginal ear vein puncture in rabbits at and h all the blood samples were analysed for glucose by godpod method the blood samples of rabbits were analysed by hplc for gliclazide gliclazide produced hypoglycaemicantidiabetic activity in normal and diabetic rats with peak activity at h and h and hypoglycaemic activity in normal rabbits at h while NIC alone produced significant hyperglycaemia at h and reduced the effect of gliclazide with no significant change in pharmacokinetics when po in combination the interaction observed appears to be pharmacodynamic at the receptor level as expected
CA,catheter ablation,TS-4340,myocardial infarction mi scar constitutes a ATP for IVT vt and an accurate delineation of infarct scar may help to identify reentrant circuits and thus facilitate CA one of the recent advancements in characterization of a vt substrate is its volumetric delineation within the VVI wall by noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging this paper compares in four TPS cases epicardial and volumetric inverse solutions using magnetic resonance imaging mri with late gadolinium enhancement as a gold standard
SA,stable angina,TS-4341,atherothrombosis and coronary artery disease affect more than million individuals only in the united states about millions in europe and are the major causes of death worldwide in particular chronic SA impairs patient quality of life is associated with an important health spending and increased patient mortality it is a prominent symptom of PD disease cad the latter being prevalent worldwide in patients a key role in pathophysiology of cardiovascular acute events is played by G1 platelets aspirin and adenosine diphosphate antagonist in addition to it is recommended for year for reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with prior myocardial infarction with a weak recommendation to continue thereafter py receptor antagonists in addition to aspirin have been shown in the last years to reduce ICM events in patients with acute coronary syndrome but their role in secondary prevention is still new and unclear the aim of our paper is to review the longterm effect of therapy with ticagrelor on the basis of recent evidence based data
SD,selective decontamination,TS-4342,the purposes of SD of the digestive tract are to treat infections that may be incubating at the time a patient is admitted to an intensive ECU icu by i.v. of antibiotics during the first days of a stay in the icu and to prevent icuacquired infections by topical application of antibiotics in the OP and the gastrointestinal tract despite multiple trials in which a considerable reduction in the incidence of ventilatorassociated pneumonia was demonstrated major objections against the routine use of selective decontamination of the digestive tract have included a lack of demonstrated reductions in mortality rates and in length of stay in individual trials a lack of costefficacy data and the threat of selection of multidrugresistant bacteria recently controlled randomized studies reported significant reductions in mortality rates among patients in icus who underwent SD of the digestive tract in combination with reduced selection of antibioticresistant pathogens however those studies were performed in settings where C2 of antibiotic resistance are low and some methodological issues remain unresolved if these beneficial results are confirmed the question of how to balance these benefits against the expected enhanced selection of MRSA VRE and possibly multidrugresistant gramnegative bacteria will emerge
MP,myenteric plexus,TS-4343,the objective of this study was to measure the relative tau and potency of cholecystokinin cck given by intraperitoneal ip and intravenous iv i.t. to stimulate foslike immunoreactivity fosli in neurons of the myenteric plexus in the duodenum and jejunum the subjects for his experiment were SD rats divided into eight treatment CG n rats per treatment four CG of rats were injected with and microgkg sulfated cck and saline control ip and the remaining CG with the same treatments iv we then detected fosli a marker for neuronal activation in the MP of the duodenum and jejunum in response to the previous doses and routes all of the cck doses administered by both routes increased fosli in the myenteric plexus of the duodenum and jejunum significantly more than saline did although both routes were efficacious in increasing fosli cck ip was significantly more potent than cck iv these data provide immunohistochemical evidence that ip administration of cck is a more potent stimulant of fosli in the SN of the MP of the duodenum and jejunum than iv i.t.
